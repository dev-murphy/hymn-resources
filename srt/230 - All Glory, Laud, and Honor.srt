1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
All glory, laud, and honor,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to thee, Redeemer, King,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
to whom the lips of children

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
made sweet hosannas ring.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thou art the King of Israel,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
thou David’s royal Son,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
who in the Lord’s name comest,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the King and Blessed One.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The company of angels

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
are praising thee on high,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and we with all creation

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
in chorus make reply.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The people of the Hebrews

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
with psalms before thee went;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
our prayer and praise and anthems

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
before thee we present.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
To thee, before thy passion,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
they sang their hymns of praise;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
to thee, now high exalted,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
our melody we raise.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thou didst accept their praises;

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
accept the prayers we bring,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
who in all good delightest,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
thou good and gracious King.
