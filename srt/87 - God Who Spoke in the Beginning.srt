1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
God who spoke in the beginning,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Forming rock and shaping spar,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Set all life and growth in motion,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Earthly world and distant star;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He who calls the earth to order

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Is the ground of what we are.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
God who spoke thro’ men and nations,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thro’ events long past and gone,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Showing still today His purpose,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Speaks supremely through His Son;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He who calls the earth to order

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Gives His word and it is done.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
God whose speech becomes incarnate –

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Christ is servant, Christ is Lord –

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Calls us to a life of service,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Heart and will to action stirred;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He who uses man’s obedience

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Has the first and final word.
