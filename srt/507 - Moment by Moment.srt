1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Living with Jesus, a new life divine,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Moment by moment I’m kept in His love;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Moment by moment I’ve life from above;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Never a trial that He is not there,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Never a burden that He doth not bear,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Never a sorrow that He doth not share,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Moment by moment I’m under His care.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Never a heart-ache, and never a groan,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Never a teardrop and never a moan;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Never a danger but there on teh throne,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Moment by moment He thinks of His own.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Never a weakness that He doth not feel,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Never a sickness that He cannot heal;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Jesus, my Savior, abides with me still.
