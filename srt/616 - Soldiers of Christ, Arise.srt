1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Soldiers of Christ,arise,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And put your armor on,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Strong in the strength which God supplies

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Through His eternal Son

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Strong in the Lord of hosts,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And in His mighty power,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Is more than conqueror.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Stand then in His great might,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
With all His strength endued,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But take, to arm you for the fight,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The panoply of God;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That, having all things done,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And all your conflicts passed,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Ye may o’ercome through Christ alone,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And stand entire at last.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
From strength to strength go on,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Wrestle and fight and pray,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Tread all the powers of darkness down

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And win the well-fought day.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Still let the Spirit cry

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In all His soldiers, “Come!”

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Till Christ the Lord who reigns on high

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Shall take the conquerors home.
