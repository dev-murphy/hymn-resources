1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We gather together to ask the Lord’s blessing;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He chastens and hastens His will to make known.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The wicked oppressing now cease from distressing.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sing praises to His Name; He forgets not His own.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Beside us to guide us, our God with us joining,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Ordaining, maintaining His kingdom divine;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So from the beginning the fight we were winning;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thou, Lord, were at our side, all glory be Thine!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We all do extol Thee, Thou leader triumphant,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And pray that Thou still our defender wilt be.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let Thy congregation escape tribulation;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thy name be ever praised! O Lord, make us free!
