1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
God, who stretched the spangled heavens

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Flung the suns in burning radiance

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Through the silent fields of space;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We, Your children in Your likeness,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Share inventive powers with You;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Great Creator, still creating,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Show us what we yet may do.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We have ventured worlds undreamed of

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Since the childhood of our race;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Knowing the ecstasy of winging

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Through untraveled realms of space,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Probed the secrets of the atom,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yielding unimagined power,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Facing us with life’s destruction

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Or our most triumphant hour.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
As each far horizon beckons,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Children of creative purpose,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Serving others, honoring You.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
May our dreams prove rich with promise;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Each endeavor well begun;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Great Creator, give us guidance

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Till our goals and Yours are one.
