1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We値l build on the Rock, the living Rock,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
On Jesus, the Rock of Ages;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So shall we abide the fearful shock,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
When loud the tempest rages.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We値l build on the Rock,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We値l build on the Rock;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We値l build on the Rock, on the solid Rock,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
On Christ, the mighty Rock.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Some build on the sinking sands of life,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
On visions of earthly treasure;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Some build on the waves of sin and strife,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Of fame, and worldly pleasure.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O build on the Rock, for ever sure,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The firm and the true foundation;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Its hope is the hope which shall endure,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The hope of our salvation.
