1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Working, O Christ, with Thee, working with Thee,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Unworthy, sinful, weak, though we may be;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Our all to Thee we give, for Thee alone we live,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And by Thy grace achieve, working with Thee.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Along the city’s waste, working with Thee,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Our eager footsteps haste, like Thee to be;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The poor we gather in, the outcasts raise from sin,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And labor souls to win, working with Thee.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Savior, we weary not, working with Thee,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
As hard as Thine our lot can never be;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Our joy and comfort this, “Thy grace sufficent is;”

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This changes toil to bliss, working with Thee.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So let us labor on, working with Thee,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Till earth to Thee is won, from sin set free;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Till men, from shore to shore, receive Thee, and adore,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And join us evermore, working with Thee.
