1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I saw one weary, sad, and torn,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
With eager steps press on the way,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Who long the hallowed cross had born,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Still looking for the promised day;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
While many a line of grief and care,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Upon his brow was furrowed there;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I asked what buoyed his spirits up,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
“O this” said he-“the blessed hope.”

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And one I saw, with sword and shield,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who boldly braved the world’s cold frown,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And fought, unyielding, on the field,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To win an everlasting crown.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Though worn with toil, oppressed by foes,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No murmur from his heart arose;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I asked what buoyed his spirits up,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
“O this!” said he-“the blessed hope.”

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And there was one who left behind

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The cherished friends of early years,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And honor, pleasure, wealth re-signed,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
To tread the path bedewed with tears.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Through trials deep and conflict sore,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yet still a smile of joy he wore;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
O! what can bouy the spirit up?

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
‘Tis this alone-the blessed hope.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
While pilgrims here we journey on

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
In this dark vale of sin and gloom,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Through tribulation, hate, and scorn,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Or through the portals of the tomb,

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Till our returning King shall come

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
To tkae His exile captives home,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
O! what can bouy the spirits up?

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
‘Tis this alone– the blessed hope.
