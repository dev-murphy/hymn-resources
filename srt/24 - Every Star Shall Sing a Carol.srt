Every star shall sing a carol;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Every creatures, high or low,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000

By whatever name you know.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
God above, Man below,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Holy is the name I know.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When the King of all creation

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Had a cradle on the earth,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Holy was the human body,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Holy was the human birth.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Every creature, high or low,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
