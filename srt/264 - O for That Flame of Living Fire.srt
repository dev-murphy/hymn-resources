1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O for that flame of living fire

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Which shone so bright in saints of old;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Which bade their souls to heaven aspire,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Calm in distress, in danger bold!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Where is that spirit, Lord, which dwelt

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In Abram’s breast, and sealed Him Thine?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Which made Paul’s heart with sorrow melt,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And glow with energy divine?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That spirit which from age to age

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Proclaimed Thy love, and taught Thy ways?

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Brightened Isaiah’s vivid page,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And breathed in David’s hallowed lays?

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Is not Thy grace as mighty now

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
As when Elijah felt its power?

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When glory beamed from Moses’ brow,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Or Job endured the trying hour?

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Remember, Lord, the ancient days;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Renew Thy work, Thy grace restore;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And while to Thee our hearts we raise,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
On us Thy Holy Spirit pour.
