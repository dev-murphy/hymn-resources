1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
weep o’er the erring one, lift up the fallen,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Though they are slighting him, still he is waiting,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
waiting the penitent child to receive;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
he will forgive if they only believe.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
back to the narrow way patiently win them;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
tell the poor wanderer a Savior has died.
