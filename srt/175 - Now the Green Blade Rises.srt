1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now the green blade rises from the buried grain,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What that in dark earth many days has lain;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Love lives again, that with the dead has been;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Love is come again like wheat arising green.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In the grave they laid Him, love by hatred slain,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thinking that He would never wake again,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Laid in the earth like grain that sleeps unseen;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Love is come again like wheat arising green.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Forth He came in triumph, like the risen grain,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He that for three days in the grave had lain;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Raised from the dead, my living Lord is seen;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Love is come again like wheat arising green.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
When our hearts are wintry, grieving, or in pain,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Your touch can call us back to life again,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Field of our hearts that dead and bare have been;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Love is come again like wheat arising green.
