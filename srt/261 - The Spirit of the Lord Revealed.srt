1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The Spirit of the Lord revealed

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
His will to saints of old;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Their heart and mind lips unsealed

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
His glory to unfold.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Amid the gloom of ancient night

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
They hailed the dawning Word,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And in the coming of the light

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Proclaimed the coming Lord.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The prophets passed; at length there came

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To sojourn and abide,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The Word incarnate, to whose name

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The prophets testified;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And He, the twilight overpast,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Himself, the Light of light,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
As man with man, revealed at last

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The Father to our sight.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Eternal Spirit, who dost speak

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
To mind and conscience still,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That we in this our day, may seek

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
To do our Father’s will,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
To us the word of life impart,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Of Christ, the living way;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Give us the quiet, humble heart

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
To hear and to obey.
