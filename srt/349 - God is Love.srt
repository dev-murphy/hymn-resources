1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Here in Christ we gather, love of Christ our calling.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Christ, our love, is with us, gladness be His greeting.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let us fear Him, yes, and love Him, God eternal.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Loving Him, let each love Christ in all his brethren.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
God is love, and where true love is

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
God Himself is there.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When we Christians gather, members of one body,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let there be in us no discord but one spirit.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Banished now be anger, strife, and every quarrel.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Christ, our God, be always present here among us.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Grant us love’s fulfillment, joy with all the blessed,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
When we see Your face, O Savior, in its glory.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Shine on us, O purest Light of all creation,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Be our bliss while endless ages sing Your praises.
