1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When Christ was lifted from the earth His arms stretched out above

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Through every culture, every birth, to draw an answering love.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Still east and west His love extends and always, near or far,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He calls and claims us as His friends and loves us as we are.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Where generation, class, or race divides us to our shame,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He sees not labels but a face, a person and a name.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thus freely loved, tho’ fully known, may I in Christ be free

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To welcome and accept His own as Christ accepted me.
