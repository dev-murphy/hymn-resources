1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Look for the way-marks as you journey on,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Look for the way-marks passing one by one;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four—

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Where are we standing? Look the way-marks o’er.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Look for the way-marks, the great prophetic way-marks,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Look for the waymarks, the great prophetic way-marks;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The journey’s almost o’er.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
First, the Assyrian kingdom ruled the world,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Then Medo-Persia’s banners were unfurled;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And after Greece held universal sway,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Rome seized the scepter—where are we today?

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Down in the feet of iron and of clay,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Weak and divided, soon to pass away;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What will the next great, glorious drama be?

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Christ and His coming, and eternity.
