1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Father, I stretch my hands to Thee;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No other help I know;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If Thou withdraw Thyself from me,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Ah, wither shall I go?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
On Thy dear Son I now believe,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
O let me feel Thy power;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And all my varied wants relieve,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In this accepted hour.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Author of faith! To Thee I lift

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My weary, longing eyes;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
O let me now receive that gift;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
My soul without it dies.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Surely Thou canst not let me die;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
O speak, and I shall live;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And here I will unwearied lie,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Till Thou Thy Spirit give.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
How would my fainting soul rejoice

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Could I but see Thy face!

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Now let me hear Thy quickening voice,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And taste Thy pardoning grace.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I do believe, I now believe

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That Jesus died for me,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And that He shed His precious blood

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
From sin to set me free.
