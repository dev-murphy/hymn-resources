1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lo, what a glorious sight appears

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To our believing eyes!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The earth and seas are passed away

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And the old rolling skies.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And the old rolling skies,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And the old rolling skies;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The earth and seas are passed away,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And the old rolling skies.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O that will be joyful, joyful, joyful!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
O that will be joyful

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
When we meet to part no more!

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
When we meet to part no more

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
On Canaan’s happy shore;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
‘Tis there we’ll meet at Jesus’ feet,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When we meet to part no more!

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Attending angels shout for joy

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And the bright armies sing-

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Mortals! Behold the sacred seat

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Of your descending King.

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Of your descending King,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Of your descending King;

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Mortals! Behold the sacred seat

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Of your descending King.

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
His own soft hand shall wipe the tears

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
From every weeping eye;

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And pains, and groans, and griefs, and fears,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And death itself shall die!

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And death itself shall die,

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And death itself shall die;

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And pains, and groans, and griefs, and fears,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And death itself shall die.

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
How long, dear Savior! Oh, how long

33
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Shall this bright hour delay?

34
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Fly swifter round, ye wheels of time!

35
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And bring the welcome day.

36
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And bring the welcome day,

37
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And bring the welcome day;

38
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Fly swifter round, ye wheels of time!

39
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And bring the welcome day.
