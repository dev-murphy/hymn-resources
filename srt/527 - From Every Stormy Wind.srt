1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
From every stormy wind that blows, From every swelling tide of woes,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There is a calm, a sure retreat: ‘Tis found beneath the mercy seat.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There is a place where Jesus sheds The oil of gladness on our heads,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A place than all besides more sweet; It is the blood-bought mercy seat.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There is a scene where spirits blend, Where friend holds fellowship with friend;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Though sundered far, by faith they meet Around one common mercy seat.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There, there, on angel’s wings we soar, And earthly cares molest no more,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And heaven comes down our souls to greet, And glory crowns the mercy seat.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Ah! whither should we flee for aid, When tempted, desolate dismayed?

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Or how the hosts of sin defeat, Had suffering saints no mercy seat?
