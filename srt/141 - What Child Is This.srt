1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What child is this, who, laid to rest,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
On Mary`s lap is sleeping?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
While shepherds watch are keeping?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This, this is Christ the King,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The babe, the son of Mary.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Why lies He in such mean estate

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Where ox and ass are feeding?

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Good Christian, fear: for sinners here

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The silent Word is pleading.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Come, peasant, king, to own Him,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The King of kings salvation brings,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
