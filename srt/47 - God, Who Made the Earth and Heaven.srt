1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
God, who made the earth and heaven, Darkness and light:

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You the day for work have given, For rest the night.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
May Your angel guards defend us,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Slumber sweet Your mercy send us,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Holy dreams and hopes attend us

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
All through the night.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And when morn again shall call us to run life’s way,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
May we still, what-e’er befall us, Your will obey.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
From the pow’r of evil hide us,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In the narrow pathway guide us,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Never be Your smile denied us

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All through the day.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Guard us waking, guard us sleeping, And, when we die,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
May we in Your mighty keeping All peaceful lie.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When the trumpet call shall wake us, Then,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
O Lord, do not forsake us,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But to reign in glory take us with You on high.

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Holy Father, throned in heaven, All holy Son,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Holy Spirit, freely given, Blest Three in One:

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Grant us grace, we now implore You,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Till we lay our crowns before You

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And in worthier strains adore You while ages run.
