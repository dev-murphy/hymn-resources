1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
At the name of Jesus every knee shall bow,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Every tongue confess Him King of glory now;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
“Tis the Father’s pleasure we should call Him Lord,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Who from the beginning was the mighty Word.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
At His voice creation sprang at once to sight,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
All the angel faces, All the hosts of light,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thrones and dominations stars upon their way,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
All the heavenly orders in their great array.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Humbled for a season, To receive a name

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
From the lips of sinners, Unto whom He came;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He is God the Savior, He is Christ the Lord,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Ever to be worshiped, Trusted and adored.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In your hearts enthrone Him: There let Him subdue

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
All that is not holy, All that is not true;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Crown Him as your captain in temptation’s hour,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let His will enfold you in its light and power.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Surely, this Lord Jesus shall return again,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
With His Father’s glory, With His angel train;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
For all wreaths of empire meet upon His brow,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And our hearts confess Him King of glory now.
