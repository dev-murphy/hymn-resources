1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Savior, breathe an evening blessing,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Ere repose our spirits seal;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sin and want we come confessing;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thou canst save, and Thou canst heal.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Though the night be dark and dreary,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Darkness cannot hide from Thee;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thou art He who, never weary,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Watchest where Thy people be.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Though destruction walk around us.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Though the arrow past us fly,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Angel guards from Thee Surround us,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We are safe if Thou art nigh.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Should swift death this night o’re-take us,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And our couch become our tomb,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
May the morn of glory wake us,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Clad in light and deathless bloom.
