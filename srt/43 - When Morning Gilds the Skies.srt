1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When morning gilds the skies my heart awaking cries,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
May Jesus Christ be praised!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Alike at work and prayer, to Jesus I repair:

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
May Jesus Christ be praised!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Whene’er the sweet church bell peals over hill and dell,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
May Jesus Christ praised!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O hark to what it sings, as joyously it rings,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
May Jesus Christ be praised!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The night becomes as day when from the heart we say:

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
May Jesus Christ be praised!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The powers of darkness fear when this sweet chant they hear:

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
May Jesus Christ be praised!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Ye nations of mankind, in this your concord find,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
May Jesus Christ praised!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let all the earth around ring joyous with the sound,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
May Jesus Christ praised!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In heaven’s eternal bliss the loveliest strain is this,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
May Jesus Christ praised!

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let earth, and sea and sky from depth to height reply,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
May Jesus Christ praised!

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Be this, while life is mine, my canticle divine:

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
May Jesus Christ be praised!

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Be this th’eternal song through all the ages long,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
May Jesus Christ be praised!
