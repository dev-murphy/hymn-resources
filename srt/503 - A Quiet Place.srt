1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There is a quiet place,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Far from the rapid pace where God can soothe my troubled mind.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sheltered by tree and flow’r,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
There in my quiet hour with Him my cares are left behind.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Whether a garden small,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Or on a mountain tall,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
New strength and courage there I find;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Then from this quiet place

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I go prepared to face a new day

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
With love for all mankind.
