1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O brother be faithful! soon Jesus will come,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For whom we have waited so long;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
O, soon we shall enter our glorious home,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And join in the conqueror’s song.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O brother be faithful! for why should we prove

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Unfaithful to Him who had shown

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Such deep, such unbounded and infinite love

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Who died to redeem us His own.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O brother be faithful! the city of gold,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Prepared for the good and the blest,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Is waiting its portals of pearl to unfold,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And welcome thee into thy rest.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Then, brother be faithful! not long shall we stay

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In weariness here, and forlorn,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Time’s dark night of sorrow is wearing away,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We haste to the glorious morn.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O brother be faithful! He soon will descend,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Creation’s omnipotent King,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
While legions of angels His chariot attend,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And palm wreaths, of victory bring.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
O brother be faithful! and soon shalt thou hear

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
They Savior pronounce the glad word,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Well done, faithful servant, they title is clear,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
To enter the joy of thy Lord.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
O brother be faithful! eternity’s years

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Shall tell for thy faithfulness now,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
When bright smiles of gladness shall scatter thy tears,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
A coronet gleam on thy brow.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
O brother be faithful! the promise is sure,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That waits for the faithful and tried;

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
To reign with the ransomed, immortal and pure,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And ever with Jesus abide.
