1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O where are the reapers that garner in

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The sheaves of the good from the fields of sin?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
With sickles of truth must the work be done,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And no one may rest till the “harvest home.”

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Where are the reapers? O who will come

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And share in the glory of the “harvest home”?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O who will help us to garner in

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The sheaves of good from the fields of sin?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The fields all are ripening, and far and wide

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The world now is waiting the harvest tide:

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But reapers are few, and the work is great,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And much will be lost should the harvest wait.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So come with your sickles, ye sons of men,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And gather together the golden grain;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Toil on till the Lord of the harvest come,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Then share ye His joy in the “harvest home.”
