1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What does the Lord require for praise and offering?

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What sacrifice, desire or tribute bid you bring?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Do justly; Love mercy; Walk humbly with your God.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Rulers of men, give ear! Should you not justice show?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Will God your pleading hear, while crime and cruelty grow?

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Do justly; Love mercy; Walk humbly with your God.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How shall our life fulfill God’s law so hard and high?

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let Christ endue our will with grace to fortify.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Then justly, in mercy we’ll humbly walk with God.
