1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O Shepherd divine, I know Thou art mine;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thy search in the night was for me.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This bleak world is cold, but warm is Thy fold;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
My Shepherd, I follow Thee.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thy beautiful lamp shineth bright o’er my way,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thy glorious light unto Thy perfect day.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thro’ pastures serene,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thro’ valleys of green,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
My Shepherd, I follow Thee.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
O Shepherd divine, I know Thou art mine;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thy great heart was broken for me.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thy grace and Thy law I picture in awe;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
They kissed upon Calvary.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Ah! Life that was given to ransom my soul,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Ah! Heart that was broken to make sinners whole,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This world is but loss

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In view of Thy cross,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
My Shepherd, I follow Thee.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
O Shepherd divine, I know Thou art mine;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I hear Thee say, “Follow thou Me.”

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thy message today illumines my way;

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The Spirit of Prophecy.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I thrill at Thy marvellous love to Thy sheep,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The way Thou dost lead to the still waters deep,

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
One staff and one rod,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
One fold and one God;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
My Shepherd, I follow Thee.
