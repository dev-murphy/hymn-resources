1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What heavenly music steals over the sea!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Entrancing the senses like sweet melody!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
‘Tis the voice of the angels borne soft on the air;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For me they are singing; their welcome I hear.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
On the banks of old Jordan, here gazing I stand,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And earnestly longing, I stretch forth my hand;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Send a convoy of angels, dear Jesus, I pray!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let me join that sweet music; come, take me away.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Though dark are the waters and rough is the wave,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If Jesus permit, the wild surges I’ll brave;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
For that heavenly music hath ravished me so,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I must join in that chorus! I’ll go! let me go!
