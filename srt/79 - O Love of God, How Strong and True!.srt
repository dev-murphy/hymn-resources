1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O love of God, how strong and true!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Eternal, and yet ever new;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Uncomprehended and unbought,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Beyond all knowledge and all thought.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O love of God, how deep and great,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Far deeper than man’s deepest hate;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Self-fed, self-kindled like the light,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Changeless, eternal, infinite.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We read thee best in Him who cam

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To bear for us the cross of shame;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Sent by the Father from on high,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Our life to live, our death to die.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We read thy power to bless and save,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
E’en in the darkness of the grave;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Still more in resurrection light

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We read the fullness of thy might.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O love of God, our shield and stay

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Through all the perils of our way!

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Eternal love, in thee we rest,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Forever safe, forever blest.
