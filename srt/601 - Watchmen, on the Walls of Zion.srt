1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Watchmen, on the walls of Zion,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What O tell us, of the night?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Is the daystar now arising?

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Will the morn soon greet our sight?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O’er your vision Shine there now

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
some rays of light?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O’er your vision Shine there now

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
some rays of light?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Tell, O tell us, are the landmarks

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
On our voyage all passed by?

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Are we nearing now the haven?

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Can we e’en the land descry?

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Do we truly See the heavenly kingdom nigh?

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Do we truly See the heavenly kingdom nigh?

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Light is beaming, day is coming!

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let us sound aloud the cry;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We behold the daystar rising

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Pure and bright in yonder sky!

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Saints, be joyful; Your redemption draweth nigh;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Saints, be joyful; Your redemption draweth nigh.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We have found the chart and compass,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And are sure the land is near;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Onward, onward we are hasting,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Soon the haven will appear;

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let your voices Sound aloud your holy cheer;

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let your voices Sound aloud your holy cheer.
