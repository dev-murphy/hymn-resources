1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Once our blessed Christ of beauty

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Was veiled off from human views;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But through suffering, death, and sorrow

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He has rent the veil in two.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O behold the Man of Sorrows!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
O behold Him in plain view!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Since her rent the veil in two;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Since her rent the veil in two.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes, He is with God, the Father,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Interceding there for you;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
For He is the Well beloved

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Since He rent the veil in two.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Holy angels bow before Him,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Men of earth give praises due;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
For He is the mighty Conqueror

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Since He rent the veil in two.
