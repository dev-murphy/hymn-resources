1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
With all Thy quickening powers;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Kindle a flame of sacred love

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In these cold hearts of ours.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O raise our thoughts from things below,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
From vanities and toys!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Then shall we with fresh courage go

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To reach eternal joys.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Awake our souls to joyful songs;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let pure devotions rise;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Till praise employs our thankful tongues,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And doubt forever dies.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Father, we would no longer live

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
At this poor, dying rate;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To Thee our thankful love we give,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
For Thine to us is great.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
With all Thy quickening powers;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Come, shed abroad a Savior’s love,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And that shall kindle ours.
