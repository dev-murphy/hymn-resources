1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hover o’er me, Holy Spirit,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Bathe my trembling heart and brow;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Come, O come and fill me now.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Fill me now, fill me now,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Jesus, come and fill me now.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come, O come and fill me now.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thou canst fill me, gracious Spirit,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Though I cannot tell Thee how;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But I need Thee, greatly need Thee;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Come, O come and fill me now.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I am weakness, full of weakness;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
At Thy sacred feet I bow;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Blest, divine, eternal Spirit,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Fill with love, and fill me now.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Cleanse and comfort, bless and save me;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Bathe, O, bathe my heart and brow;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Thou art comforting and saving,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Thou art sweetly filling now.
