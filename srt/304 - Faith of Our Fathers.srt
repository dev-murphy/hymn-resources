1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Faith of our fathers, living still,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
O how our hearts beat high with joy

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Whenever we hear that glorious Word!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We will be true to thee till death.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Were still in heart and conscience free:

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How sweet would be their children’s fate.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If they, like them, could die for thee!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We will be true to thee till death.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Faith of our fathers, we will love

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Both friend and foe in all our strife;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And preach Thee, too, as love knows how

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
By kindly words and virtuous life.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We will be true to thee till death.
