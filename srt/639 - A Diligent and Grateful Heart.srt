1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A diligent and grateful heart

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Prompts me to sing Thy praise.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Thy love and mercies from the start

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Have blessed me all my days.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I thank Thee for the means to serve

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
With talents and with tithes,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For sharing brings the utmost joy

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
When lifting other lives.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
To minister through deeds,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To serve and share with patient care

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thy people in their needs.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
O Lord, I dedicate my all

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In this response to Thee.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Help me to magnify this call

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In deep humility.
