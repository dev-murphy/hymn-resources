1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Holy Spirit, light divine,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Shine upon this heart of mine,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Chase the shades of night away,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Turn my darkness into day.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Holy Spirit, power divine,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Cleanse this guilty heart of mine;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Long has sin, without control,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Held dominion o’er my soul.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Holy Ghost, with joy divine,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Cheer this saddened heart of mine,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Bid my many woes depart,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Heal my wounded, bleeding heart.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Holy Spirit, all divine,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Dwell within this heart of mine,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Cast down every idol throne,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Reign supreme, and reign alone.
