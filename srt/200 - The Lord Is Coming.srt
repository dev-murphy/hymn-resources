1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The Lord is coming, let this be

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The herald note of jubilee;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And when we meet and when we part

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The salutation from the heart.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Refrain:

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Lord is coming, let this be

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The herald note of jubilee,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The herald note of jubilee.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The Lord is coming, sound it forth

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
From east to west, from south to north;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Speed on! Speed on the tidings glad,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That none who love Him may be sad.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Refrain:

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The Lord is coming, let this be

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The herald note of jubilee,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The herald note of jubilee.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The Lord is coming, swift and sure

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And all His judgements shall endure,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And none can hope to escape His wrath,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Who walk not in the narrow path.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Refrain:

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The Lord is coming, let this be

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The herald note of jubilee,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The herald note of jubilee.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
This earth, with her ten thousand wrongs

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Will soon be tuned to nobler songs;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Our praise shall then, in realms of light,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
With all His universe unite.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Refrain:

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The Lord is coming, let this be

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The herald note of jubilee,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The herald note of jubilee.
