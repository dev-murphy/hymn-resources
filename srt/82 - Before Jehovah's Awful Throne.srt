1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Before Jehovah’s awful throne,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Ye nations, bow with sacred joy;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Know that the Lord is God alone;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He can create, and He destroy.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
His sovereign power, without our aid,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Made us of clay, and formed us men;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and when like wandering sheep we strayed,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He brought us to His fold again.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We’ll crowd His gates with thankful songs,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
High as the heavens our voices raise;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Shall fill His courts with sounding praise.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Wide as the world is His command,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Vast as Eternity His love;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Firm as a rock His truth shall stand,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
When rolling years shall cease to move.
