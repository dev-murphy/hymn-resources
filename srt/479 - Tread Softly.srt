1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Be silent, be silent, A whisper is heard;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Be silent, and listen, Oh treasure each word.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Tread softly, tread softly, The Master is here;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Tread softly here, tread softly here,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Tread softly, tread softly, He bids us draw near.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Tread softly here, tread softly here,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Be silent, be silent, For holy this place,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This altar that echoes The message of grace.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Be silent, be silent, Breathe humbly our prayer;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
A foretaste of Eden This moment we share.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Be silent, be silent, His mercy record;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Be silent, be silent, And wait on the Lord.
