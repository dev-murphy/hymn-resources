1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In imitation, Lord, of Thee,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This solemn service we repeat;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For Thine example full of grace,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Has made this humble duty sweet.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Renew each sacred spark of love,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And vitalize the holy flame;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
May union strong our hearts unite

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
While this we do in Jesus’ name.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Our great example Thou shalt be,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In washing Thy disciples feet;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And as we follow Thy command,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Make Thou our fellowship complete.
