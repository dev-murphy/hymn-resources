1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Softly now the light of day

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Fades upon out sight away:

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Free from care, from labor free,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Lord, we would commune with Thee.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thou, whose allpervading eye

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Nought escapes, without, within,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Pardon each infirmity,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Open fault, and secret sin.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Soon from us the light of day

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Shall forever pass away;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Then, from sin and sorrow free,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Take us, Lord, to dwell with Thee.
