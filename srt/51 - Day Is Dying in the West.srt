1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Day is dying in the west;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Heaven is touching earth with rest;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Wait and worship while the night

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sets the evening lamps alight

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Through all the sky.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Heaven and earth are full of Thee!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Heaven and earth are praising Thee,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O Lord most high!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Lord of life, beneath the dome

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Of the universe, Thy home,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Gather us who seek Thy face

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
To the fold of Thy embrace,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
For Thou art nigh.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
While the deepening shadows fall,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Heart of love enfolding all,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Through the glory and the grace

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Of the stars that veil Thy face,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Our hearts ascend.

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
When forever from our sight

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Pass the stars, the day, the night,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Lord of angels, on our eyes

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let eternal morning rise

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And shadows end.
