1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jerusalem the golden,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
With milk and honey blest,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Beneath thy contemplation

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sink heart and voice oppressed.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I know not, O I know not

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What holy joys are there;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What radiancy of glory,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What bliss beyond compare.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
They stand, those hall of Zion,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
All jubilant with song,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And bright with many an angel,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And all the martyr throng.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The Prince is ever in them,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The daylight is serene;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The pastures of the blessed

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Are deck in glorious sheen.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
There is the throne of David,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And there, from care released,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The shout of them that triumph,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The song of them that feast;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And they who, with their Leader,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Have conquered in the fight,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Forever and forever

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Are clad in robes of white.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
O sweet and blessed country,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The home of God’s elect!

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
O sweet and blessed country,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That eager hearts expect!

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Jesus, in mercy bring us

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
To that dear land of rest;

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Who art, with God the Father,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And Spirit, ever blest.
