1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When on life a darkness falls,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When the mist flows chilling,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Paths and sign posts lost in doubt,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Loveless, unfulfilling,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Reach us, Jesus, from Your cross,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Though we feel forsaken;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Keep us through the aching night

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
When the dreams and vows of youth

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Painfully accuse us,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Stab our conscience, steal our worth,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Christ will not refuse us:

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Peace the world cannot provide,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Daily resurrection,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Strong companion at our side

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
For each new direction.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Come and meet Him, Friend and Lord,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thro’ the gospel story:

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Open door to life and peace,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Window into glory.

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All who seek Him, soon are found,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Made His close relation:

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Christ our pathway, Christ our home,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Christ our sure foundation.
