1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Holy Sabbath day of rest,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
By our Master richly blest,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
God created and divine,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Set aside for holy time.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, the holy Sabbath rest,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
By our God divinely blest,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It to us a sign shall be

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Throughout all eternity.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Seek not pleasures of this earth,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
With its folly, noise, and mirth,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There are better things in store,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Over on the other shore.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
As the Sabbath draweth on

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Friday eve at set of sun,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Christian household then should meet,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Sing and pray at Jesus’feet.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Asking Him for saving grace,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Also vict’ry in the race,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And to help us by His pow’r,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
To keep holy every hour.
