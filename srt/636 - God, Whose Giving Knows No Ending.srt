1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
God, whose giving knows no ending,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
From Your rich and endless store:

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Nature’s wonder, Jesus’ wisdom,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Costly cross, grave’s shattered door.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Gifted by You, we turn to You,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Off’ring up ourselves in praise:

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thankful song shall rise forever,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Gracious donor of our days.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Skills and time are ours for pressing

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Toward the goals of Christ, Your Son:

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All at peace in health and freedom,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Races joined, the church made one.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Now direct our daily labor,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Lest we strive for self alone:

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Fit to answer at Your throne.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Treasure, too, You have entrusted,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Gain through pow’rs Your grace conferred:

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Ours to use for home and kindred,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And to spread the Gospel Word.

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Open wide our hands in sharing,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
As we heed Christ’s ageless call.

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Healing, teaching, and reclaiming,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Serving You by loving all.
