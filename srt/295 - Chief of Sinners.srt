1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Chief of sinners though I be,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Jesus shed His blood for me;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Died that I might live on high,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Died that I might never die;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
As the brance is to the vine,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I am His, and He is mine.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O the height of Jesus’ love!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Higher than the heaven above,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Deeper than the deepest sea,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Lasting as eternity;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Love that found me-wondrous thought!

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Found me when I sought Him not!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Chief of sinners though I be,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Christ is all in all to me;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All my wants to Him are known,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
All my sorrows are His own;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Safe with Him from earthly strife,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He sustains the hidden life.
