1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Stand up, stand up for Jesus! ye soldiers of the cross;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Lift high His royal banner, it must not suffer loss:

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
From vict’ry unto vict’ry, His army shall He lead,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Till every foe is vanquished, and Christ is Lord indeed.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Stand up, stand up for Jesus! The trumpet call obey:

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Forth to the mighty conflict, in this His glorious day;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Ye that are men now serve Him against unnumbered foes;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let courage rise with danger, and strength to strength oppose.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Stand up, stand up for Jesus! Stand in His strength alone,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The arm of flesh will fail you, ye dare not trust your own;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Put on the gospel armor, and watching unto prayer,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Where calls the voice of duty, be never wanting there.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Stand up, stand up for Jesus! the strife will not be long;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This day the noise of battle, the next the victor’s song;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To him that overcometh a crown of life shall be;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He with the King of glory shall reign eternally.
