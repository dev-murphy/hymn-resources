1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let us sing a song that will cheer us by the way,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In a little while we’re going home.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For the night will end in the everlasting day,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In a little while we’re going home.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In a little while, In a little while,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We shall cross the billow’s foam;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We shall meet at last, When the stormy winds are past,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In a little while we’re going home.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We will do the work that our hands may find to do,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In a little while we’re going home.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And the grace of God will our daily strength renew,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In a little while we’re going home.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We will smooth the path for some weary, wayworn feet,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In a little while we’re going home.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And may loving hearts spread around an influence sweet!

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
In a little while we’re going home.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
There’s a rest beyond, there’s relief from every care,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In a little while we’re going home;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And no tears shall fall in that city bright and fair,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
In a little while we’re going home.
