1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There’s a song in the air!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There’s a star in the sky!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There’s a mother’s deep prayer

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And a baby’s low cry!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And the star rains its fire

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
while the beautiful sing,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For the manger of Bethlehem

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
cradles a King!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There’s a tumult of joy

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
O’er the wonderful birth,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
For the virgin’s sweet boy

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Is the Lord of the earth.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Aye! the star rains its fire

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
while the beautiful sing,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
For the manger of Bethlehem

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
cradles a King!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In the light of that star

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Lie the ages impearled;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And that song from afar

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Has swept over the world.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Every hearth is aflame

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and the beautiful sing

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
In the homes of the nations

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
that Jesus is King!

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We rejoice in the light,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And we echo the song

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That comes down through the night

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
From the heavenly throng.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Aye! we shout to the lovely evangel they bring,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And we greet in His cradle

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
our Savior and King!
