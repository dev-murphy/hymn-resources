1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thou art the potter, I am the clay.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Mold me and make me after thy will,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
while I am waiting, yielded and still.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Search me and try me, Savior today!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Wash me just now, Lord, wash me just now,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
as in thy presence humbly I bow.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Wounded and weary, help me I pray!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Power, all power, surely is thine!

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Touch me and heal me, Savior divine!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hold o’er my being absolute sway.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Fill with thy Spirit till all shall see

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Christ only, always, living in me!
