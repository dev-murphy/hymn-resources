1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I will follow Thee, my Savior,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Wheresoe’er my lot may be.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Where thou goest I will follow;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes, my Lord, I’ll follow Thee.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I will follow Thee, my Saviour,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thou didst shed Thy blood for me;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And though all men should forsake Thee;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
By Thy grace I’ll follow Thee.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Though the road be rough and thorny,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Trackless as the foaming sea,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thou hast trod this way before me,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And I’ll gladly follow Thee.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Though I meet with tribulations,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Sorely tempted though I be;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I remember Thou wast tempted,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And rejoice to follow Thee.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Though Thou leadest me through affliction,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Poor, forsaken though I be;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Thou wast destitute, afflicted,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And I only follow Thee.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Though to Jordan’s rolling billows,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Cold and deep, Thou leadest me,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Thou hast crossed the waves before me,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And I still will follow Thee.
