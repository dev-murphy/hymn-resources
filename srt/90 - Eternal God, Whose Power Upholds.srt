1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Eternal God, whose power upholds Both flower and flaming star,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To whom there is no here nor there, No time, no near nor far,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
No alien race, no foreign shore, No child unsought, unknown:

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
O send us forth, Your prophets true, To make all lands Your own!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O God of truth, whom science seeks And reverent souls adore,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Illumine every earnest mind Of every clime and shore:

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Dispel the gloom of error’s night, Of ignorance and fear,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Until true wisdom from above Shall make life’s pathway clear!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O God of beauty, oft revealed In dreams of human art,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In speech that flows to melody, In holiness of heart:

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Teach us to ban al ugliness, And all disharmony,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Till all shall know the loveliness Of lives made fair and free!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O God of righteousness and grace, Seen in the Christ, Your Son,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Whose life and death reveal Your face, By whom Your will was done;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Help us to spread Your gracious reign Till greed and hate shall cease,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And kindness dwell in human hearts, And all the earth find peace!
