1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O Master, let me walk with thee

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in lowly paths of service free;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
tell me thy secret; help me bear

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the strain of toil, the fret of care.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Help me the slow of heart to move

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
by some clear, winning word of love;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
teach me the wayward feet to stay,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and guide them in the homeward way.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Teach me thy patience; still with thee

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
in closer, dearer company,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
in work that keeps faith sweet and strong,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
in trust that triumphs over wrong;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In hope that sends a shining ray

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
far down the future’s broadening way,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
in peace that only thou canst give,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
with thee, O Master, let me live.
