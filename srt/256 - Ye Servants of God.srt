1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and publish abroad his wonderful name;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the name all-victorious of Jesus extol,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
his kingdom is glorious and rules over all.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
God ruleth on high, almighty to save,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and still he is nigh, his presence we have;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
the great congregation his triumph shall sing,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
ascribing salvation to Jesus, our King.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
“Salvation to God, who sits on the throne!”

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let all cry aloud and honor the Son;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the praises of Jesus the angels proclaim,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
fall down on their faces and worship the Lamb.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Then let us adore and give him his right,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
all glory and power, all wisdom and might;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
all honor and blessing with angels above,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and thanks never ceasing and infinite love.
