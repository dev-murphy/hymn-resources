1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Give to our God immortal praise;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Mercy and truth are all His ways:

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Wonders of grace to God belong,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Repeat His mercies in your song.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Give to the Lord of lords renown,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The King of kings with glory crown:

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
His mercies ever shall endure

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
When lords and kings are known no more.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He sent His Son with power to save

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
From guilt and darkness and the grave:

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Wonders of grace to God belong,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Repeat His mercies in your song.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thro’ this vain world He guides our feet,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And leads us to His heav’nly seat;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
His mercies ever shall endure,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
When this vain world shall be no more.
