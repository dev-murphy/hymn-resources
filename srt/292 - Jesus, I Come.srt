1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Out of my bondage, sorrow and night,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Jesus, I come, Jesus, I come;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Into Thy freedom, gladness and light,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Jesus, I come to Thee;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Out of my sickness into Thy health,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Out of my want and into Thy wealth,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Out of my sin and into Thyself,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Jesus, I come to Thee.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Out of my shameful failure and loss,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Jesus, I come, Jesus, I come;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Into the glorious gain of Thy cross,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Jesus, I come to Thee;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Out of earth’s sorrows into Thy balm,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Out of life’s storms and into Thy calm,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Out of distress to jubilant psalm,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Jesus, I come to Thee.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Out of unrest and arrogant pride,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Jesus, I come, Jesus, I come;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Into Thy blessed will to abide,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Jesus, I come to Thee;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Out of myself to dwell in Thy love,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Out of despair into raptures above,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Upward for aye on wings like a dove,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Jesus, I come to Thee.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Out of the fear and dread of the tomb,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Jesus, I come, Jesus, I come;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Into the joy and light of Thy home,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Jesus, I come to Thee;

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Out of the depths of ruin untold,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Into the peace of Thy sheltering fold,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Ever Thy glorious face to behold,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Jesus, I come to Thee.
