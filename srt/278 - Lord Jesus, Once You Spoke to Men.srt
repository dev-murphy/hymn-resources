1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord Jesus, once You spoke to men

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Upon the mountain and the plain,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
O help us listen now as then

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And wonder at Your words again.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We all have secret fears to face,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Our minds and motives to amend.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We seek Your truth,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We need your grace,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Our living Lord and present friend.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The gospel speaks; and we receive

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Your light, Your love,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Your own command.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O help us live what we believe,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In daily word of heart and hand.
