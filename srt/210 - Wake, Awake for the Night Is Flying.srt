1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Wake, awake, for night is flying,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The watchmen on the heights are crying,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Awake, Jerusalem, arise!

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Midnight’s solemn hour is tolling,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
His chariot wheels are nearer rolling,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He comes; prepare, ye virgins wise.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Rise up with willing feet

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Go forth, the Bridegroom meet; Alleluia!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Bear through the night your well-trimmed light,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Speed forth to join the marriage rite.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Zion hears the watchmen singing,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Her heart with deep delight is springing,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
She wakes, she rises from her gloom;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Forth her Bridegroom comes, all-glorious,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In grace arrayed, by truth victorious;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Her Star is risen, her Light is come!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
All hail, incarnate Lord,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Our crown, and our reward! Alleluia!

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We haste along, in pomp and song,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And gladsome join the marriage throng.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Lamb of God, the heavens adore Thee,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And men and angels sing before Thee,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
With harp and cymbal’s clearest tone.

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
By the pearly gates in wonder

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We stand, and swell the voice of thunder,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That echoes round Thy dazzling throne.

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
No vision ever brought,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No ear hath ever caught,

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Such bliss and joy;

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We raise the song, we swell the throng,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
To praise Thee ages all along.
