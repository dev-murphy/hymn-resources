1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My Shepherd will supply my need,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Jehovah is His name.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In pastures fresh He makes me feed

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Beside the living stream.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He brings my wand’ring spirit back

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When I forsake His ways,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And leads, me for His mercy’s sake,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In paths of truth and grace.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
When I walk through the shades of death,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thy presence is my stay;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
A word of Thy supporting breath

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Drives all my fears away.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thy hand in sight of all my foes

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Doth still my table spread;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
My cup with blessings overflows,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thine oil anoints my head.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The sure provisions of my God

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Attend me all my days;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
O may Thy house be mine abode

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And all my work be praise.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
There would I find a settled rest

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
While others go and come;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No more a stranger or a guest,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But like a child at home.
