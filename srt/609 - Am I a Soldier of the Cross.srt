1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Am I a soldier of the cross,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
a follower of the Lamb,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and shall I fear to own his cause,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
or blush to speak his name?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Must I be carried to the skies

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
on flowery beds of ease,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
while others fought to win the prize,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and sailed through bloody seas?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Are there no foes for me to face?

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Must I not stem the flood?

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Is this vile world a friend to grace,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to help me on to God?

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sure I must fight, if I would reign;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
increase my courage, Lord

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I’ll bear the toil, endure the pain,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
supported by thy word

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thy saints in all this glorious war

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
shall conquer though they die;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
they see the triumph from afar,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
by faith they bring it nigh

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
When that illustrious day shall rise,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and all thy armies shine

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
in robes of victory through the skies,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
the glory shall be thine
