1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O Love that wilt not let me go,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I rest my weary soul in thee;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I give thee back the life I owe,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that in thine ocean depths

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
its flow may richer, fuller be.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
O Light that followest all my way,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I yield my flickering torch to thee;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
my heart restores its borrowed ray,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
that in they sunshine’s blaze

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
its day may brighter, fairer be.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
O Joy that seekest me through pain,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I cannot close my heart to thee;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I trace the rainbow thru the rain,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and feel the promise is not vain,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
that morn shall tearless be.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
O Cross that liftest up my head,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I dare not ask to fly from thee;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I lay in dust life’s glory dead,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and from the ground there blossoms

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
red life that shall endless be.
