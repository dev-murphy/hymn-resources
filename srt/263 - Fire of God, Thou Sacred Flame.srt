1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Fire of God, Thou sacred flame,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Spirit who in splendor came,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let Thy heat my soul refine

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Till it glows with love divine.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Breath of God, that swept in power

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In the pentecostal hour,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Holy Breath, be Thou in me

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Source of vital energy.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Strength of God, Thy might within

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Conquers sorrow, pain, and sin:

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Fortify from evil’s art

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All the gateways of my heart.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Truth of God, Thy piercing rays

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Penetrate my secret ways.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
May the light that shames my sin

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Guide me holier paths to win.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Love of God, Thy grace profound

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Knoweth neither age nor bound:

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Come, my heart’s own guest to be,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Dwell forevermore in me.
