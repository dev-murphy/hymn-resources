1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
For the beauty of the earth,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
for the glory of the skies,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
for the love which from our birth

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
over and around us lies;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Lord of all, to Thee we raise

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
this our grateful song of praise.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For the joy of human love,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
brother, sister, parent, child,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
friends on earth and friends above,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Pleasures pure and undefiled,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Lord of all, to Thee we raise

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
this our grateful song of praise.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
For the gift of Thy dear Son,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
for the hope of heaven at last,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
for the Spirit’s victory won,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
For the crown when life is past,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Lord of all, to Thee we raise

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Songs of gratitude and praise.
