1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My soul, be on they guard!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Ten thousand foes arise;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The hosts of sin are pressing hard

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To draw thee from the skies.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O watch, and fight, and pray!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The battle ne’er give o’er;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Renew it boldly every day,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And help divine implore.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Ne’er think the victory won,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Nor lay thine armor down;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thy arduous task will not be done

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Till thou obtain the crown.
