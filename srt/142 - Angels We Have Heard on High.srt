1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Angels we have heard on high

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Sweetly singing o’er the plains,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And the mountains in reply

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Echoing their joyous strains.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Shepherds, why this jubilee?

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why your joyous strains prolong?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What the gladsome tidings be

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Which inspire your heavenly song?

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Come to Bethlehem and see

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Christ Whose birth the angels sing;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Come, adore on bended knee,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
See Him in a manger laid,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Whom the choirs of angels praise;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
While our hearts in love we raise.
