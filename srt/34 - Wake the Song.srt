1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Wake the song of joy and gladness;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hither bring your noblest lays;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Banish every thought of sadness,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Pouring forth your highest praise.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sing to Him whose care has brought us

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Once again with friends to meet,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And whose loving voice has taught us

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Of the way to Jesus’ feet.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Wake the song, wake the song,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The song of joy and gladness,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Wake the song, wake the song,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The song of Jubilee.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Joyfully with songs and banners,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We will greet the festal day;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Shout aloud our glad hosannas,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And our grateful homage pay.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We will chant our Savior’s glory

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
while our thoughts we raise above,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Telling still the old, old, story,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Precious theme- redeeming love!

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thanks to Thee, O holy Father,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
For the mercies of the year;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
May each heart, as here we gather,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Swell with gratitude sincere,

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Thanks to Thee, O loving Savior,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
For redemption through Thy blood.

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Breathe upon us, Holy Spirit,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Sweetly draw us near to God.
