1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O sing a new song to the Lord

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For marvels He has done;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
His right hand and His holy arm

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The victory have won.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
With harp, and voice of psalms

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Unto Jehovah sing;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let trumpets and the echoing horn

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Acclaim the Lord our King!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let seas with all their creatures roar,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The world and dwellers there,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And let the rivers clap their hands,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The hills their joy declare.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Before the Lord: because He comes,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To judge the earth come He;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He’ll judge the world

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
with righteousness,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
His folk with equity.
