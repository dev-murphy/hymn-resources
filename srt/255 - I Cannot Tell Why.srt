1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I cannot tell why He whom angels worship

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Should set His love upon the souls of men,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Or why as Shepherd He should seek the wanderers,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To bring them back, they know not

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
how nor when.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But this I know, that He was born of Mary

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When Bethlehem’s manger was His only home,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And that He lived at Nazareth and laboured;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And so the Saviour, Saviour of the world, has come.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I cannot tell how silently He suffered

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
As with His peace He graced this place of tears,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Nor how His heart upon the cross was broken,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The crown of pain to three and thirty years.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But this I know He heals the broken hearted

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And stays our sin and calms our lurking fear,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And lifts the burden from the heavy laden;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
For still the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is here.

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I cannot tell how He will win the nations,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
How He will claim His earthly heritage,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
How satisfy the needs and aspirations

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Of east and west, of sinner and of sage.

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But this I know, all flesh shall see His glory,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And He shall reap the harvest He has sown,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And some glad day His sun will shine in splendour

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
When He the Saviour, Saviour, of the world, is known.

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I cannot tell how all lands shall worship,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
When at His biding every storm is stilled,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Or who can say how great the jubilation

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
When all our hearts with love for Him are filled.

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But this I know the skies shall sound His praises,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Ten thousand thousand human voices sing,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And earth to heaven, and heaven to earth will answer,

33
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:15,000
At last the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is King!
