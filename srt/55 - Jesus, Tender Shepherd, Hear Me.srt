00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Bless Thy little lamb tonight;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Through the darkness be Thou near me;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Watch my sleep till morning light.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
All this day Thy hand has led me,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And I thank Thee for Thy care;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thou hast clothed me, warmed and fed me;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Listen to my evening prayer.
