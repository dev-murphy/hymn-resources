1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Glorious things of thee are spoken,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Zion, city of our God;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He whose word cannot be broken

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Formed thee for His own abode;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
On the Rock of Ages founded,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What can shake thy sure repose?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
With salvation’s wall surrounded,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thou mayest smile at all thy foes.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
See the streams of living waters

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Springing from eternal love,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Well supply thy sons and daughters,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And all fear and want remove;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Who can faint when such a river

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Ever flows their thirst to assuage?

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Grace, which, like the Lord, the Giver,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Never fails from age to age.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Round each habitation hovering,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
See the cloud and fire appear

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
For a glory and a covering,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Showing that the Lord is near;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Blest inhabitants of Zion,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Washed in the Redeemer’s blood;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Jesus, whom their souls rely on,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Makes them kings and priests to God.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Savior, if of Zion’s city

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I, through grace, a member am,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let the world deride or pity,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I will glory in Thy name;

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Fading is the worldling’s pleasure,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
All his boasted pomp and show;

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Solid joys and lasting treasure

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
None but Zion’s children know.
