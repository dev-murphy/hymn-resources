1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Redeemed thro’ His infinite mercy,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
His child, and forever, I am.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Redeemed, redeemed,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
His child and forever I am.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I think of my blessed Redeemer,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I think of Him all the day long;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I sing, for I cannot be silent;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
His love is the theme of my song.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I know I shall see in His beauty

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The King in whose law I delight,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And giveth me songs in the night.
