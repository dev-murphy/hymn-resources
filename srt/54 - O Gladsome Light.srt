1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O gladsome light,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Of God the Father’s face,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The eternal splendour wearing;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Celestial, holy, blest,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Our Saviour, Jesus Christ,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Joyful in Thine appearing.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Now e’er day fadeth quite,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We see the evening light,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Our wonted hymn outpouring;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Father of might unknown,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thee His incarnate Son,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And Holy Spirit adoring.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
To Thee of right belongs

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
All praise of holy songs,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
O Son of God, life giver;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thee, therefore, O most high,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The world doth glorify

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And shall exalt forever.
