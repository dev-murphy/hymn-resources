1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come, you faithful, raise the strain

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Of triumphant gladness;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
God has brought His Israel

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Into joy from sadness;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Loosed from Pharoah’s bitter yoke

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Jacob’s sons and daughters;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Led them with unmoistened foot

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Through the Red Sea waters.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
‘Tis the spring of souls today;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Christ has burst His prison,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And from three days’sleep in death

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
As a sun has risen;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All the winter of our sins,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Long and dark, is flying

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
From His light, to whom is giv’n

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Laud and praise undying.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Now the queen of seasons, bright

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
With the day of splendor,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
With the royal feast of feasts,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Comes its joy to render;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Comes to gladden faithful hearts

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Which with true affection

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Welcome in unwearied strain

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Jesus’resurrection.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
For today among the twelve

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Christ appeared, be stowing

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
His deep peace, which evermore

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Passes human knowing.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Neither could the gates of death,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Nor the tomb’s dark portal,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Nor the watchers, nor the seal,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Hold Him as a mortal.

33
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:15,000
“Alleluia!” now we cry

34
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:30,000
To our King immortal,

35
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Who, triumphant, burst the bars

36
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Of the tomb’s dark portal;

37
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:15,000
“Alleluia” with the Son,

38
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:30,000
God the Father praising;

39
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:45,000
“Alleluia!” yet again

40
00:09:45,000 --> 00:10:00,000
To the Spirit raising.
