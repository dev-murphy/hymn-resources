1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Prince of Peace, control my will,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Bid this struggling heart be still;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Bid my fears and doubtings cease,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hush my spirit into peace.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thou hast bought me with Thy blood,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Opened wide the gate to God;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Peace, I ask, but peace must be,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Lord, in being one with Thee.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
May Thy will, not mine, be done,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
May Thy will and mine be one;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Chase these doubtings from my heart,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Now Thy perfect peace impart.
