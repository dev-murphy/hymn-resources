1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My heav’nly home is bright and fair,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Nor pain nor death can enter there;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It’s glitt’ring tow’rs the sun outshine,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That heav’nly mansion shall me mine.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I’m going home, I’m going home,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I’m going home to die no more;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
To die no more; to die no more-

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I’m going home to die no more.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
My Father’s house is built on high,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Far, far above the starry sky;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
When from this earthly prison free,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That heav’nly mansion mine shall be.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let others seek a home below,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Which flames devour or waves oe’r flow;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Be mine a happier lot to own

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
A heav’nly mansion near the throne.
