1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord God, Your love has called us here,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
As we, by love, for love were made.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Your living likeness still we bear

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Tho’ marred, dishonored, disobeyed.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We come, with all our heart and mind

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Your call to hear, Your love to find.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We come with self inflicted pains

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Of broken trust and chosen wrong,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Half free, half bound by inner chains,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
By social forces swept along,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
By powers and systems close confined,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yet seeking hope for human kind.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Lord God, in Christ You call our name,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And then receive us as Your own,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Not thro’ some merit, right, or claim,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But by Your gracious love alone.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We strain to glimpse Your mercy seat,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And find You kneeling at our feet.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Then take the towel, and break the bread,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And humble us, and call us friends.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Suffer and serve till all are fed

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And show how grandly love intends

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
To work till all creation sings,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
To fill all worlds, to crown all things.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Lord God, in Christ You set us free

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Your life to live, Your joy to share.

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Give us Your Spirit’s liberty

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
To turn from guilt and dull despair

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And offer all that faith can do,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
While love is making all things new.
