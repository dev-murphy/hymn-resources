1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord, who dost give to Thy church for its healing

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Gifts, and the grace to sustain and renew,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hear as we pray that today and each morrow

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We to Thy purpose may show ourselves true.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Clear be the voices of preachers and prophets

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Fearlessly speaking the word of the Lord,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Word of redemption thro‘ God’s Son incarnate,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Blessing for cursing, and peace for the sword.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Tender and wise be the hearts of the pastors,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Guiding and guarding the souls in their care,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Firm with the wayward, a strength to the doubting,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Helping the needy their burdens to bear.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
May those who teach grow in knowledge and patience,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Guiding to wisdom the young and the old,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Training for worship and witness and service,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Foes to all falsehood, in truthfulness bold.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Lord, ever give to us gifts in due measure,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Each needing other, and all having worth;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Glory be shown by the church here on earth.
