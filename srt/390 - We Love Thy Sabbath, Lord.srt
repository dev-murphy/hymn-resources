1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We love Thy Sabbath, Lord,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And worship at Thy will;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh may these hours sweet peace afford

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And deeper faith instill.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thine angels sang for joy

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Creation’s work to see;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We too, this day, would raise our hearts

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In grateful praise to Thee.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Praise for Thy wondrous love,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That sealed this sacred day,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
A sign that all may understand

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We own Thy sovereign sway.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O great Creator King,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Through Thy redeeming grace,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Renew and sanctify our hearts

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That we may see Thy face.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And with the white-robed throng,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Upon Mount Sion be,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And joyful sing our Sabbath song

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Through all eternity.
