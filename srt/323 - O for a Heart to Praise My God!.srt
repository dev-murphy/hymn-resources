1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O for a heart to praise my God,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A heart from sin set free,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
A heart that always feels Thy blood

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So freely shed for me.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
A heart resigned, submissive, meek,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
My dear Redeemer’s throne,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Where only Christ is heard to speak,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Where Jesus reigns alone.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
A heart in every thought renewed

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And full of love divine,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Perfect and right and pure and good,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
A copy, Lord, of Thine.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Come quickly from above;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Write Thy new name upon my heart,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thy new, best name of Love.
