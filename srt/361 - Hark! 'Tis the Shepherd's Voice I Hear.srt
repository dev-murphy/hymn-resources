1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hark! ’tis the Shepherd’s voice I hear,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Out in the desert dark and drear,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Calling the sheep who’ve gone astray,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Far from the Shepherd’s fold away.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Bring them in, Bring them in,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Bring them in from the fields of sin;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Bring them in, Bring them in,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Bring the wanderers to Jesus.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Who’ll go and help the Shepherd kind,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Help Him the wandering ones to find?

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Who’ll bring them back into the fold,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Where they’ll be sheltered from the cold?

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Out in the desert hear their cry,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Out on the mountain wild and high,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hark! ’tis the Master speaks to thee,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
“Go, find My sheep where ‘er they be.”
