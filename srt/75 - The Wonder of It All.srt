00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There’s the wonder of sunset at evening,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The wonder as sunrise I see;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But the wonder of wonders that thrills my soul

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Is the wonder that God loves me.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O, the wonder of it all!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The wonder of it all!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Just to think that God loves me.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O, the wonder of it all!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The wonder of it all!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Just to think that God loves me.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There’s the wonder of springtime and harvest,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The sky, the stars, the sun;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But the wonder of wonders that thrills my soul

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Is the wonder that’s only begun.
