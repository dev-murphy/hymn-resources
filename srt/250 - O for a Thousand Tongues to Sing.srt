1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O for a thousand tongues to sing

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
my great Redeemer’s praise,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the glories of my God and King,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the triumphs of his grace!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
My gracious Master and my God,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
assist me to proclaim,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
to spread through all the earth abroad

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the honors of thy name.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Jesus! the name that charms our fears,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
that bids our sorrows cease;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
’tis music in the sinner’s ears,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
’tis life, and health, and peace.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He breaks the power of canceled sin,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
he sets the prisoner free;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
his blood can make the foulest clean;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
his blood availed for me.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He speaks, and listening to his voice,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
new life the dead receive;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
the mournful, broken hearts rejoice,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the humble poor believe.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hear him, ye deaf; his praise, ye dumb,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
your loosened tongues employ;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
ye blind, behold your savior come,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and leap, ye lame, for joy.
