1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
God is working His purpose out

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
As year suceeds to year;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
God is working His purpose out,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And the time is drawing near;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Nearer and nearer draws the time,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The time that shall surely be

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
As the waters cover the sea.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
From utmost east to utmost west,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Where’er man’s foot hath trod,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
By the mouth of many messengers

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Goes forth the voice of God;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Give ear to me, ye confinents,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Ye isles, give ear to me,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That the earth shall be filled with the glory of God

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
As the waters cover the sea.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
March we forth in the strength of God

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
With the banner of Christ unfurled,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That the light of the glorious gospel of truth

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
May shine throughout the world:

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Fight we the fight with sorrow and sin

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
To set their captives free,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That the earth shall be filled with the glory of God

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
As the waters cover the sea.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
All we can do is nothing worth

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Unless God blesses the deed;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Vainly we hope for the harvest tide

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Till God gives life to teh seed;

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yet nearer and nearer draws the time,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The time that shall surely be,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
As the waters cover the sea.
