1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
for thee all the follies of sin I resign.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art thou;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I love thee because thou hast first loved me,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and purchased my pardon on Calvary’s tree;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I love thee for wearing the thorns on thy brow;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I’ll love Thee in life, I will love Thee ’til death,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And say when the death dew lies cold on my brow,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In mansions of glory and endless delight;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I’ll ever adore thee in heaven so bright;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I’ll sing with the glittering crown on my brow;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.
