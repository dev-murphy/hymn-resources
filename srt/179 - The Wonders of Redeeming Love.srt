00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The wonders of redeeming love

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Our highest thoughts exceed;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The Son of God comes from above

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For sinful man to bleed.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He gives Himself, His life, His all,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A sinless sacrifice.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For man He drains the cup of gall,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
For man the victim dies.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And now before His Father’s face

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
His precious blood He pleads;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
For those who seek the throne of grace

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
His love still intercedes.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He knows the frailties of our frame,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
For He has borne our grief;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Our great High Priest once felt the same,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And He can send relief.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
His love will not be satisfied,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Till He in glory sees

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The faithful ones for whom He died

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
From sin forever free.

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
