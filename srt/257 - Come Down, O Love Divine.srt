1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come down, O Love divine, seek thou this soul of mine

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and visit it with thine own ardor glowing;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
O Comforter, draw near, within my heart appear,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and kindle it, thy holy flame bestowing.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O let it freely burn, till earthly passions turn

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
to dust and ashes in its heat consuming;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and let thy glorious light shine ever on my sight,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and clothe me round, the while my path illuming.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let holy charity Mine outward vesture be,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And lowliness become my inner clothing;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
True lowliness of heart which takes the humbler part,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And o’er its own shortcomings weeps with loathing.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And so the yearning strong with which the soul will long

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
shall far outpass the power of human telling;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
for none can guess its grace, till Love create a place

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
wherein the Holy Spirit makes a dwelling.
