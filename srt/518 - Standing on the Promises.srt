1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Standing on the promises of Christ my King,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thru eternal ages let His praises ring;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Glory in the highest I will shout and sing,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Standing on the promises of God.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Standing, standing,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Standing on the promises

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
of God my Savior;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Standing, standing,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I’m standing on the promises of God.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Standing on the promises that cannot fail,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
By the living word of God I shall prevail,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Standing on the promises of God.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Bound to Him eternally by love’s strong cord,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Overcoming daily with the Spirit’s sword,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Standing on the promises of God.
