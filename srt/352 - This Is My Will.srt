1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is My will, My one command,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That love should dwell among you all.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This is My will that you should love

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
As I have shown that I love you.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No greater love a man can have

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Than that he die to save his friends.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You are My friends if you obey

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What I command that you should do.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You chose not Me, but I chose you

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That you should go and bear much fruit.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I chose you out that you in Me

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Should bear much fruit that will abide.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All that I ask My Father, dear,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
For My name’s sake you shall receive.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This is My will, My one command,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That love should dwell in each, in all.
