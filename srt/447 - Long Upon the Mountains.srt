1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Long upon the mountains weary,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Have the scattered flocks been torn;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Dark the dessert paths, and dreary;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Grievous trials have they borne.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now the gathering call is sounding,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Solemn in its warning voice;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Union, faith, and love, abounding,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Bid the little flock rejoice.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now the light of truth they’re seeking,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In its onward track pursue;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All the ten commandments keeping,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
They are holy, just, and true.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
On the words of lire they’re feeding,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Precious to their taste so sweet;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All their Master’s percepts heeding,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Bowing humbly to His feet.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In that light of light and beauty,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In that golden city fair,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Soon its pearly gates they’ll enter,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And of all its glories share.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
There, divine the soul’s expansions;

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Free from sin, and death, and pain;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Tear will never dim those mansions

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Where the souls immortal reign.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Soon He comes! With clouds descending;

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
All His saints, entombed arise;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The redeemed, in anthems blending,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Shout their vict’ry thro’ the skies.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
O, we long for Thine appearing;

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Come, O Savior, quickly come!

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Blessed hope! Our spirits cheering,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Take thy ransomed children home.
