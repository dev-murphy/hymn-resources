1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
From the eastern mountains Pressing on they come,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Wise men in their wisdom, To His humble home;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Stirred by deep devotion, Hasting from afar,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Ever journeying onward, Guided by a star.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There their Lord and Savior Meek and lowly,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Wondrous light that led them Onward on their way,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Ever now to lighten Nations from afar,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
As they journey homeward By that guiding star.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Gather in the outcasts All who’ve gone astray,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Throw Thy radiance o’er them, Guide them on their way;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Those who never knew Thee, Those who’ve wandered far,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Guide them by the brightness Of Thy guiding star.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Until every nation, Whether bond or free,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
‘Neath Thy starlit banner, Jesus follows thee.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
O’er the distant mountains To that heavenly home,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Where no sin nor sorrow Evermore shall come.
