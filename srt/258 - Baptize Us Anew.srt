1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Baptize us anew With power from on high,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
With love, O refresh us! Dear Savior, draw nigh.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We humbly beseech Thee, Lord Jesus, we pray,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
With love and the Spirit baptize us today.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We praise Thee, we bless Thee, dear Lamb that was slain

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We laud and adore Thee, Amen and Amen.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Unworthy we cry, Unholy, unclean,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O wash us and cleanse us From sin’s guilty stain.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O heavenly Dove, Descend from on high!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We plead Thy rich blessing; In mercy draw nigh.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
O list the glad voice! From heaven it came:

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thou art My beloved, Well pleased I am.
