1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I must tell Jesus all of my trials,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I cannot bear these burdens alone;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In my distress He kindly will help me,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He ever loves and cares for His own.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I cannot bear my burdens alone;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Jesus can help me, Jesus alone.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I must tell Jesus all of my troubles,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He is a kind, compassionate Friend;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If I but ask Him He will deliver,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Make of my troubles quickly an end.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh, how the world to evil allures me!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, how my heart is tempted to sin!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I must tell Jesus, and He will help me

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Over the world the vict’ry to win.
