1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Built on the Rock the Church shall stand,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Even when steeples are falling;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Crumbled have spires in every land,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Bells still are chiming and calling

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Calling the young and old to rest,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Calling the souls of those distressed,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Longing for life everlasting.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Not in our temples made with hands

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
God, the Almighty, is dwelling;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
High in the heav’ns His temple stands,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All earthly temples excelling.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yet He who dwells in heav’n above

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Deigns to abide with us in love,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Making our bodies His temple.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We are God’s house of living stones,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Built for His own habitation;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He fills our hearts, His humble thrones,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Granting us life and salvation.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Were two or three to seek His face,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He in their midst would show His grace,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Blessings upon them bestowing.

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yet in this house, an earthly frame,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Jesus His children is blessing;

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hither we come to praise His name,

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Faith in our Savior confessing.

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Jesus to us His Spirit sent,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Making with us His covenant,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Granting His children the kingdom.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Thro‘ all the passing years, O Lord,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Grant that, when church bells are ringing,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Many may come to hear God’s Word

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Where He this promise is bringing:

33
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I know My own, My own know Me:

34
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You, not the world, My face shall see;

35
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:45,000
My peace I leave with you. Amen.
