1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I love to tell the story

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
of unseen things above,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
of Jesus and his glory,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
of Jesus and his love.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I love to tell the story,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
because I know ’tis true;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
it satisfies my longings

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
as nothing else can do.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I love to tell the story,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
’twill be my theme in glory,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
to tell the old, old story

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
of Jesus and his love.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I love to tell the story;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
more wonderful it seems

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
than all the golden fancies

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
of all our golden dreams.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I love to tell the story,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
it did so much for me;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and that is just the reason

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I tell it now to thee.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I love to tell the story;

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
’tis pleasant to repeat

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
what seems, each time I tell it,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
more wonderfully sweet.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I love to tell the story,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
for some have never heard

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
the message of salvation

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
from God’s own holy Word.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I love to tell the story,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
for those who know it best

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
seem hungering and thirsting

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
to hear it like the rest.

33
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And when, in scenes of glory,

34
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I sing the new, new song,

35
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:45,000
’twill be the old, old story

36
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:00,000
that I have loved so long.
