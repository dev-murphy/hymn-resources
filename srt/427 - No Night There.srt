1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the land of fadeless day

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Lies “the city four-square;”

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It shall never pass away,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And there is “no night there.”

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
God shall “wipe away all tears;”

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There’s no death, no pain, nor fears;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And they count not time by years,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
For there is “no night there.”

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
All the gates of pearl are made,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In “the city four-square;”

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All the streets with gold are laid,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And there is “no night there.”

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And the gates shall never close

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To “the city four-square;”

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
There life’s crystal river flows,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And there is “no night there.”

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
There they need no sunshine bright,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In “that city four-square;”

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
For the Lamb is all the light,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And there is “no night there.”
