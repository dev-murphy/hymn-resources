1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Alleluia! sing to Jesus! His the scepter, His the throne.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Alleluia! His the triumph, His the victory alone.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hark! the songs of peaceful Zion thunder like a mighty flood.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Jesus out of every nation has redeemed us by His blood.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Alleluia! not as orphans are we left in sorrow now;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Alleluia! He is near us, faith believes, nor questions how;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Though the cloud from sight received Him when the forty days were o’er

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Shall our hearts forget His promise, “I am with you evermore”?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Alleluia! bread of angels, Thou on earth our food, our stay;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Alleluia! here the sinful flee to Thee from day to day:

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Intercessor, Friend of sinners, Earth’s Redeemer, plead for me,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Where the songs of all the sinless sweep across the crystal sea.
