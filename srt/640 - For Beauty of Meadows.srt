1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
For beauty of meadows, for grandeur of trees,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For flowers of woodlands, for creatures of seas,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For all You created and gave us to share,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We praise You,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Creator, extolling your care.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
As stewards of beauty received at Your hand,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
As creatures who hear Your most urgent command,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We turn from our wasteful destruction of life,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Confessing our failures, confessing our strife.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Teach us once again to be gardeners in peace;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All nature around us is ours but on lease;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Fulfilling our calling, creating with You.
