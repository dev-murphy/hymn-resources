1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
“We would see Jesus;” for the shadows lengthen

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Across the little landscape of our life;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We would see Jesus, our weak faith to strengthen

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For the last conflict, in this mortal strife.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
“We would see Jesus,” Rock of our salvation,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Where on our feet were set with sovereign grace;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Not life, nor death, with all their agitation,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Can thence remove us, gazing on His face.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
“We would see Jesus;” other lights are paling,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Which for long years we did rejoice to see;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The blessings of this sinful world are failing;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We would not mourn them, in exchange for Thee.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
“We would see Jesus;” this is all we’re needing-

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Strength, joy and willingness come with the sight;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We would see Jesus, dying, risen, pleading,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Soon to return and end this mortal night!
