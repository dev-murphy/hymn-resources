1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What wondrous love is this,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
O my soul, O my soul?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What wondrous love is this, O my soul?

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What wondrous love is this

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That caused the Lord of bliss

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To bear the dreadful curse for my soul, for my soul;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
To bear the dreadful curse for my soul, for my soul;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To God and to the Lamb

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I will sing, I will sing;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To God and to the Lamb, I will sing;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
To God and to the Lamb

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Who is the great I am,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
While millions join the theme, I will sing, I will sing;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
While millions join the theme, I will sing, I will sing;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And when from death I知 free,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I値l sing on, I値l sing on;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And when from death I知 free, I値l sing on;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And when from death I知 free,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I値l sing and joyful be,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And through eternity I値l sing on, I値l sing on!

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And through eternity, I値l sing on.
