1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Christ is the world’s true light,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Its captain of salvation,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The daystar clear and bright

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Of every man and nation;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
New life, new hope awakes

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Where’er men own His sway:

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Freedom her bondage breaks,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And night is turned to day.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
In Christ all races meet,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Their ancient feuds forgeting,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The whole round world complete,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
From sunrise to its setting:

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
When Christ is throned as Lord,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Men shall forsake their fear,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To plowshare beat the sword,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
To pruning hook the spear.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
One Lord, in one great name

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Unite us all who own Thee,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Cast out our pride and shame

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That hinder to enthrone Thee;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The world has waited long,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Has travailed long in pain,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
To heal its ancient wrong,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Come, Prince of Peace, and reign.
