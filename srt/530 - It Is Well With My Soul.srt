1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
when sorrows like sea billows roll;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It is well, it is well with my soul.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It is well with my soul,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
it is well, it is well with my soul.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
My sin–oh, the joy of this glorious thought–

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
My sin, not in part but the whole,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the clouds be rolled back as a scroll;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
the trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
even so, it is well with my soul.
