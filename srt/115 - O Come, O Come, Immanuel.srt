1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O come, O come, Immanuel,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And ransom captive Israel,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That mourns in lonely exile here

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Until the Son of God appear.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Rejoice! Rejoice!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Immanuel shall come to thee,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O Israel.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O come, Thou Wisdom from on high,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And order all things far and night;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To us the path of knowledge show,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And cause us in her ways to go.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
O come, Desire of nations, bind

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All peoples in one heart and mind;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Bid envy, strife and quarrels cease;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Fill the whole world with heaven’s peace.
