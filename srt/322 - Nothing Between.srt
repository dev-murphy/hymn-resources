1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Nothing between my soul and my Savior,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
naught of this world’s delusive dream;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I have renounced all sinful pleasure;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Jesus is mine, there’s nothing between.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Nothing between my soul and my Savior,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
so that his blessed face may be seen;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
nothing preventing the least of his favor;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
keep the way clear! let nothing between.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Nothing between, like worldly pleasure;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
habits of life, though harmless they seem,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
must not my heart from him ever sever;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
he is my all, there’s nothing between.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Nothing between, e’en many hard trials,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
though the whole world against me convene;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
watching with prayer and much self denial,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I’ll triumph at last, there’s nothing between.
