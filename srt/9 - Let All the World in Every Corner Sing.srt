1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let all the world in every corner sing, My God and King!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The heavens are not too high, His praise may thither fly;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The earth is not too low, His praises there may grow.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let all the world in every corner sing, My God and King!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let all the world in every corner sing, My God and King!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The church with psalms must shout, No door can keep them out;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But, above all, the heart must bear the longest part.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let all the world in every corner sing, My God and King!
