1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that saved a wretch like me!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I once was lost, but now am found;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
was blind, but now I see.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
‘Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and grace my fears relieved;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
how precious did that grace appear

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the hour I first believed.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The Lord has promised good to me,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
his word my hope secures;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
he will my shield and portion be,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
as long as life endures.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Through many dangers, toils, and snares,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I have already come;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
’tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and grace will lead me home.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
When we’ve been there ten thousand years,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
bright shining as the sun,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
we’ve no less days to sing God’s praise

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
than when we first begun.
