1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The judgment has set, the books have been opened;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
How shall we stand in that great day,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When every thought, and word, and action,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
God, the righteous Judge, shall weigh?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
How shall we stand in that great day?

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How shall we stand in that great day?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Shall we be found before Him wanting?

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Or with our sins all washed away?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The work is begun with those who are sleeping,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Soon will the living here be tried,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Out of the books of God’s remembrance,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
His decision to abide.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O, how shall we stand that moment of searching,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
When all our sins those books reveal?

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When from that court, each case decided,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Shall be granted no appeal?
