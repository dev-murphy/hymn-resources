1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Blest be the King whose coming

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Is in the name of God!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For Him let doors be opened,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No hearts against Him barred!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Not robed in royal splendor,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In power and pomp comes He;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But clad as are the poorest,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Such His humility.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Blest be the King whose coming

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Is in the name of God!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
By those who truly listen

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
His voice is truly heard;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Pity the proud and haughty,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Who have not learned to heed

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The Christ who is the promise,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Who has atonement made.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Blest be the King whose coming

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Is in the name of God!

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He only to the humble

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Reveals the face of God.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
All power is His, all glory!

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
All things are in His hand,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
All ages and all peoples,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
‘Till time itself shall end.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Blest be the King whose coming

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Is in the name of God!

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He offers to the burdened

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The rest and grace they need.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Gentle is He and humble!

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And light his Yoke shall be,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
For He would have us bear it,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So He can made us free!
