1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Pass me not, O gentle Savior,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
hear my humble cry;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
while on others thou art calling,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
do not pass me by.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
while on others thou art calling,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
do not pass me by.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let me at thy throne of mercy

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
find a sweet relief,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
kneeling there in deep contrition;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
help my unbelief.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Trusting only in thy merit,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
would I seek thy face;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
heal my wounded, broken spirit,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
save me by thy grace.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thou the spring of all my comfort,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
more than life to me,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
whom have I on earth beside thee?

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Whom in heaven but thee?
