1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
As it fell upon a night

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In the winter weather,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Angels bright in starry height

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Began to sing together.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Shepherds sleeping on the plain

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Woke to see the glory,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
All amazed they stood and gazed

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And heard the angels’ story.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Unto you a child is born

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In a manger lowly,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Humble, He, yet born to be

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The King of Love most holy.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Happy angels from afar,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Cease your singing never!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In excelsis gloria!

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Forever and forever.
