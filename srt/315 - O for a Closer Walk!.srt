1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O for a closer walk with God,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A calm and heavenly frame,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
A light to shine upon the road

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That leads me to the Lamb!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Return, O holy Dove, return,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Sweet messenger of rest!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I hate the sins that made Thee mourn

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And drove Thee from my breast.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How sweet their memory still!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But they have left an aching void

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The world can never fill.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The dearest idol I have known,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What-e’er that idol be,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Help me to tear it from Thy throne,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And worship only Thee.
