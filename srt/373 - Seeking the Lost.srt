1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Seeking the lost, yes, kindly entreating

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Wanderers on the mountain astray;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
“Come unto Me,” His message repeating,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Words of the Master speaking today.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Going afar (going afar)

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Upon the mountain (upon the mountain)

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Bringing the wanderer back again, back again,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Into the fold (into the fold)

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Of my Redeemer (of my Redeemer)

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Jesus the Lamb for sinners slain, for sinners slain.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Seeking the lost and pointing to Jesus

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Souls that are weak and hearts that are sore,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Leading them forth in ways of salvation,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Showing the path to life evermore.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thus would I go on missions of mercy,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Following Christ from day unto day,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Cheering the faint and raising the fallen,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Pointing the lost to Jesus, the Way.
