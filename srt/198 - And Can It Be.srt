1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And can it be that I should gain

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
an interest in the Savior’s blood!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Died he for me? who caused his pain!

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For me? who him to death pursued?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Amazing love! How can it be

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Amazing love! How can it be

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
that thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He left his Father’s throne above

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
so free, so infinite his grace!;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
emptied himself of all but love,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and bled for Adam’s helpless race.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
‘Tis mercy all, immense and free,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
for O my God, it found out me!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Long my imprisoned sprit lay,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
fast bound in sin and nature’s night;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
thine eye diffused a quickening ray;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
my chains fell off, my heart was free,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I rose, went forth, and followed thee.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No condemnation now I dread;

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Jesus, and all in him, is mine;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
alive in him, my living Head,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and clothed in righteousnes divine,

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
bold I approach th’ eternal throne,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and claim the crown, through Christ my own.
