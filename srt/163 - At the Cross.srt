1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Alas! and did my Savior bleed,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and did my Sovereign die?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Would he devote that sacred head

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
for sinners such as I?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
At the cross, at the cross,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
where I first saw the light,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and the burden of my heart rolled away;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
it was there by faith I received my sight,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and now I am happy all the day!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Was it for crimes that I have done,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
he groaned upon the tree?

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Amazing pity! Grace unknown!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And love beyond degree!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But drops of grief can ne’er repay

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
the debt of love I owe:

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Here, Lord, I give myself away;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
’tis all that I can do!
