1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The church has waited long

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Her absent Lord to see;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And still in loneliness she waits,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A friendless stranger she.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
How long, O Lord our God,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Holy and true and good,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Wilt Thou not judge Thy suffering church,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Her sighs and tears and blood?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We long to hear Thy voice,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To see Thee face to face,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
To share Thy crown and glory then,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
As now we share Thy grace.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Come, Lord, and wipe away

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The curse, the sin, the stain,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And make this blighted world of ours

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thine own fair world again.
