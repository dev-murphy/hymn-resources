1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Nature with open volume stands,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To spread its Maker’s praise abroad;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And every labor of His hands

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Shows something worthy of our God.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But in the grace that rescued us

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
His brightest form of glory shines;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
‘Tis fairest drawn upon the cross

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In precious blood and crimson lines.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Here His whole name appears complete.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Nor wit can guess, nor reason prove,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Which of the letters best is writ,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The pow’r, the wisdom, or the love.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We would forever speak His name

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In sounds to mortal ears unknown,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
With angels join to praise the Lamb,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And worship at His Father’s throne.
