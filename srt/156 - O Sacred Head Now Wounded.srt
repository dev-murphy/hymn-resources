1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O sacred Head, now wounded,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
with grief and shame weighed down,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
now scornfully surounded

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
with thorns, thine only crown:

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
how pale thou art with anguish,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
with sore abuse and scorn!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How does that visage languish

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
which once was bright as morn!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What thou, my Lord, has suffered

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
was all for sinners’ gain;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
mine, mine was the transgression,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
but thine the deadly pain.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Lo, here I fall, my Savior!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
‘Tis I deserve thy place;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
look on me with thy favor,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
vouchsafe to me thy grace.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What language shall I borrow

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
to thank thee, dearest friend,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
for this thy dying sorrow,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
thy pity without end?

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
O make me thine forever;

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and should I fainting be,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Lord, let me never, never

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
outlive my love for thee.
