1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O sing a song of Bethlehem,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Of shepherds watching there,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And of the news that came to them

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
From angels in the air:

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The light that shone on Bethlehem

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Fills all the world today;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Of Jesus’birth and peace on earth

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The angels sing alway.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O sing a song of Nazareth,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Of sunny days of joy,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
O sing of fragrant flowers breath,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And of the sinless Boy:

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
For now the flowers of Nazareth

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In every heart may grow;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Now spreads the fame of His dear name

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
On all the winds that blow.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O sing a song of Calvary,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Its glory and dismay;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Of Him who hung upon the tree,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And took our sins away:

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
For He who died on Calvary

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Is risen from the grave;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And Christ, our Lord, by heaven adored,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Is mighty now to save.
