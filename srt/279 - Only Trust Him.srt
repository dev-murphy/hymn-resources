1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come, every soul by sin oppressed,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There’s mercy with the Lord,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And He will surely give you rest,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
By trusting in His word.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Only trust Him, only trust Him,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Only trust Him now;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He will save you, He will save you,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He will save you now.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
For Jesus shed his precious blood

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Rich blessings to bestow;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Plunge now into the crimson flood

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That washes white as snow.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes, Jesus is the truth, the way,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That leads you into rest;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Believe in Him without delay,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And you are fully blest.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Come, then, and join this holy band,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And on to glory go,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
To dwell in that celestial land,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Where joys immortal flow.
