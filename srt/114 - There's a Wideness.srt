1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There’s a wideness, in God’s mercy,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
like the wideness of the sea;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There is mercy, with the Savior,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Which is more than liberty.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There is welcome, for the sinner,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and more graces for the good;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There is mercy, with the Savior,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There is healing in His blood.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
For the love of God is broader

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Than the measure of man’s mind.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And the heart of the Eternal,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
is most wonderfully kind.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If our love were but more simple,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We should take Him at His word;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And our lives would be all sunshine,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
In the sweetness of our Lord.
