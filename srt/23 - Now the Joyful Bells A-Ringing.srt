1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now the joyful bells a-ring,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All ye mountains of the Lord!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Lift our hearts like birds a-winging,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All ye mountains, praise the Lord!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now our festal season bringing

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Kinsmen all to bide and board,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sets our cheery voices singing;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
All ye mountains, praise the Lord!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Dear our home as dear none other;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Where the mountains praise the Lord!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Gladly here our care we smother;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Where the mountains praise the Lord!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Here we know that Christ our brother

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Binds us all as by a cord:

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He was born of Mary mother

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Where the mountains praise the Lord!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Cold the year, new whiteness wearing,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
All ye mountains, praise the Lord!

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Peace, good will to us a-bearing,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All ye mountains, praise the Lord!

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Now we all God’s goodness sharing

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Break the bread and sheath the Sword:

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Bright our hearths the signal flaring,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
All ye mountains, praise the Lord!
