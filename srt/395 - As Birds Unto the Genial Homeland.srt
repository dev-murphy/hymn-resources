1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
As birds unto the genial homeland fly,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The winter’s cold and low’ring skies to flee,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So seeks my soul Thy gracious presence here

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And finds, O God, its rest and peace in Thee.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Here at Thy shrine we leave all vexing care,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For get the disappointment, grief and tear,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And on the wings of hopeful song and prayer

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We rise, and rising feel Thy Spirit here.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Bless all who spend this night in pain and woe,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The burdened heart, the fainting, and distressed,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thy comfort send to darkened homes bereaved,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thy saving help to those by want oppressed.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Come, Sabbath joy, each trusting heart now fill,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And blissful peace within our homes abide,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
May thankful praise each grateful heart now thrill,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And to God’s loving care their lives confide.
