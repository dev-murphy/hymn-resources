1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Spirit of God, descend upon my heart;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
wean it from earth; through all its pulses move;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
stoop to my weakness, mighty as thou art,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and make me love thee as I ought to love.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I ask no dream, no prophet ecstasies,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
no sudden rending of the veil of clay,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
no angel visitant, no opening skies;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
but take the dimness of my soul away.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Has thou not bid me love thee, God and King?

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
All, all thine own, soul, heart and strength and mind.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I see thy cross; there teach my heart to cling.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
O let me seek thee, and O let me find.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Teach me to feel that thou art always nigh;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
teach me the struggles of the soul to bear.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To check the rising doubt, the rebel sigh,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
teach me the patience of unanswered prayer.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Teach me to love thee as thine angels love,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
one holy passion filling all my frame;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
the kindling of the heaven-descended Dove,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
my heart an altar, and thy love the flame.
