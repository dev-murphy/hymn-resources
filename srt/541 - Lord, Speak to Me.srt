1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord, speak to me, that I may speak

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in living echoes of thy tone;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
as thou has sought, so let me seek

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
thine erring children lost and lone.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O lead me, Lord, that I may lead

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the wandering and the wavering feet;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O feed me, Lord, that I may feed

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
thy hungering ones with manna sweet.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O strengthen me, that while I stand

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
firm on the rock, and strong in thee,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I may stretch out a loving land

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to wrestlers with the troubled sea.
