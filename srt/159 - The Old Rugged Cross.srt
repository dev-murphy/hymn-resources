1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the emblem of suffering and shame;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and I love that old cross where the dearest and best

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
for a world of lost sinners was slain.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
till my trophies at last I lay down;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I will cling to the old rugged cross,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and exchange it some day for a crown.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
has a wondrous attraction for me;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
for the dear Lamb of God left his glory above

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to bear it to dark Calvary.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
To that old rugged cross I will ever be true,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
its shame and reproach gladly bear;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
then he’ll call me some day to my home far away,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
where his glory forever I’ll share.
