1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I致e wandered far away from God,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now I知 coming home;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The paths of sin too long I致e trod;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Lord, I知 coming home.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Coming home, coming home

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Never more to roam;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Open wide Thine arms of love;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Lord I知 coming home.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I致e wasted many precious years,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now I知 coming home;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I now repent with bitter tears;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Lord, I知 coming home.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I知 tired of sin and straying Lord,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Now I知 coming home;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I値l trust thy love belive thy word;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Lord I知 coming home.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
My only hope, my only plea,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Now I知 coming home;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That Jesus died, and died for me;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Lord I知 coming home.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I need His cleansing blood I know,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Now I知 coming home;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
O wash me whiter than the snow;

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Lord I知 coming home.
