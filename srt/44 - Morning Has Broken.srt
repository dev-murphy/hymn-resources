1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Morning has broken like the first morning,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Blackbird has spoken like the first bird.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Praise for the singing!Praise for the morning!

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Praise for the springing fresh from the Word!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sweet the rain’s new fall sunlit from heaven,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Like the first dewfall on the first grass.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Sprung in completeness where His feet pass.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Mine is the sunlight! Mine is the morning

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Born of the one light Eden saw play!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Praise with elation, Praise every morning,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
God’s recreation of the new day!
