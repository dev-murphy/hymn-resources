1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Sing we of the modern city,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Scene alike of joy and stress;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sing we of its nameless people

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In their urban wilderness.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Into endless rows of houses

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Life is set a millionfold,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Life expressed in human beings

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Daily born and growing old.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
In the city full of people,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
World of speed and hectic days,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
In the ever-changing setting

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Of the latest trend and craze,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Christ is present, and among us;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In the crowd we see Him stand.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In the bustle of the city

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Jesus Christ is every man.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
God is not remote in heaven,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But on earth to share our shame,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Changing graph and mass and number

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Into persons with a name.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Christ has shown, beyond statistics,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Human life with glory crowned,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
By His timeless presence proving

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
People matter, people count!
