1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is the threefold truth

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
On which our faith depends;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And with this joyful cry

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Worship begins and ends;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Refrain:

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Christ has died!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Christ is risen!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Christ will come again!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
By this we are upheld

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When doubt and grief assails

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Our Christian fortitude,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And only grace avails.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Refrain:

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Christ has died!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Christ is risen!

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Christ will come again!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This is the threefold truth

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Which, if we hold it fast,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Changes the world and us

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And brings us home at last.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Refrain:

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Christ has died!

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Christ is risen!

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Christ will come again!
