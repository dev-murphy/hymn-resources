1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I come to the garden alone,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
While the dew is still on the roses;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Son of God discloses.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And He walks with me,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And He talks with me,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And He tells me I am His own;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And the joy we share as we tarry there,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
None other has ever known.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He speaks, and the sound of His voice

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And the melody that He gave to me

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Within my heart is ringing.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I’d stay in the garden with Him

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Though the night around me be falling,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But He bids me go; through the voice of woe,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
His voice to me is calling.
