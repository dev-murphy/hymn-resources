1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O Christian, awake! ’tis the Master’s command;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
With helmet and shield, and a sword in thy hand,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
To meet the bold tempter, go, fearlessly go,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Stand like the brave, stand like the brave,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The cause of thy Master with vigor defend;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Be watchful, be zealous, and fight to the end;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Wherever He leads thee, go, valiantly go,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Press on, never doubting, thy Captain is near,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
With grace to supply, and with comfort to cheer;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
His love, like a stream in the desert will flow;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.
