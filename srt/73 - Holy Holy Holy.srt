1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
God in three persons, blessed Trinity!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Holy, holy, holy! Angels adore Thee,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Casting down their bright crowns around the glassy sea;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thousands and ten thousands worship low before Thee,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Which wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Holy, holy, holy! though the darkness hide Thee,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Though the eye of  man Thy great glory may not see;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Perfect in power, in love, and purity.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
All Thy works shall praise Thy name, in earth, and sky, and sea;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Holy, holy, holy; merciful and mighty!

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
God in three persons, blessed Trinity!
