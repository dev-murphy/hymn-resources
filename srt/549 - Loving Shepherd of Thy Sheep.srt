1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Loving Shepherd of Thy sheep,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Keep Thy lamb, in safety keep;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Nothing can Thy power withstand;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
None can pluck me from Thy hand.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Loving Shepherd, ever near,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Teach Thy lamb Thy voice to hear;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Suffer not my steps to stray

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
From the straight and narrow way.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Where Thou leadest I would go,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Walking in Thy steps below,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Till within the heavenly fold

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I my Shepherd shall behold.
