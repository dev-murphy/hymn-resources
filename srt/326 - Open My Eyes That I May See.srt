1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Open my eyes, that I may see

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Place in my hands the wonderful key

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That shall unclasp and set me free.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Silently now I wait for Thee,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Ready, my God, Thy will to see;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Open my eyes,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
illumine me, Spirit Divine!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Open my ears that I may hear

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Voices of truth Thou sendest clear;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and while the wavenotes fall on my ear,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Everything false will disappear.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Silently now I wait for Thee,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Ready, my God, Thy will to see;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Open my ears, illumine me, Spirit Divine!

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Open my mouth, and let me bear

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Gladly the warm truth everywhere;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Open my heart, and let me prepare

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Love with Thy children thus to share.

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Silently now I wait for Thee,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Ready, my God, Thy will to see;

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Open my heart, illumine me, Spirit Divine!
