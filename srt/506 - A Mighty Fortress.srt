1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A mighty fortress is our God,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
a bulwark never failing;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
our helper he amid the flood

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
of mortal ills prevaling.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
For still our ancient foe

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
doth seek to work us woe;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
his craft and power are great,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and armed with cruel hate,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
on earth is not his equal.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Did we in our own strength confide,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
our striving would be losing,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
were not the right man on our side,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
the man of God’s own choosing.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Dost ask who that may be?

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Christ Jesus, it is he;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Lord Sabbaoth, his name,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
from age to age the same,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and he must win the battle.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And though this world, with devils filled,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
should threaten to undo us,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
we will not fear, for God hath willed

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
his truth to triumph through us.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The Prince of Darkness grim,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
we tremble not for him;

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
his rage we can endure,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
for lo, his doom is sure;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
one little word shall fell him.

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That word above all earthly powers,

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
no thanks to them, abideth;

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
the Spirit and the gifts are ours,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
thru him who with us sideth.

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Let goods and kindred go,

33
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:15,000
this mortal life also;

34
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:30,000
the body they may kill;

35
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:45,000
God’s truth abideth still;

36
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:00,000
his kingdom is forever.
