1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Silent night! holy night!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All is calm, all is bright

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Round yon virgin mother and Child,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Holy Infant so tender and mild,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sleep in heavenly peace,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
sleep in heavenly peace.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Silent night! holy night!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Shepherds quake at the sight,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
glories stream from heaven afar,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
heavenly hosts sing Alleluia;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Christ, the Savior is born,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Christ, the Savior is born.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Silent night! holy night!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Son of God, love’s pure light,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Radiant beams from Thy holy face,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
with the dawn of redeeming grace,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.
