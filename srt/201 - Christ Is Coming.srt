1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Christ is coming! let creation

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Bid her groans and travail cease;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let the glorious proclamation

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hope restore and faith increase;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
(Prince of Peace!)

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Earth can now but tell the story

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Of Thy bitter cross and pain;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
She shall yet behold Thy glory

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
When Thou comest back to reign;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let each heart repeat the strain.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
(repeat the strain)

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let each heart repeat the strain.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
With that “blessed hope” before us,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let no harp remain unstrung;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let the mighty advent chorus

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Onward roll from tongue to tongue:

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
(quickly come!)

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!
