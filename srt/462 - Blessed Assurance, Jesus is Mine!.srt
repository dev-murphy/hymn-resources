1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
O what a foretaste of glory divine!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Heir of salvation, purchase of God,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
born of his Spirit, washed in his blood.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is my story, this is my song,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
praising my Savior all the day long;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
this is my story, this is my song,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
praising my Savior all the day long.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Perfect submission, perfect delight,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
visions of rapture now burst on my sight;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
angels descending bring from above

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Perfect submission, all is at rest;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I in my Savior am happy and blest,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
watching and waiting, looking above,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
filled with his goodness, lost in his love.
