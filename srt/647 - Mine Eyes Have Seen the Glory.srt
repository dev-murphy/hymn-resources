1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He has loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
His truth is marching on.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Our God is marching on.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
As He died to make men holy, let us live to make men free!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
While God is marching on.
