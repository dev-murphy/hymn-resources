1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The Lord’s my shepherd, I’ll not want

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He makes me down to lie

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In pastures green; he leadeth me

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The quiet waters by.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He leadeth me, He leadeth me

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The quiet waters by.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
My soul he doth restore again

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And me to walk doth make

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Within the paths of righteousness

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Even for his own name’s sake.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Within the paths of righteousness

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Even for his own name’s sake.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yea, though I walk through death’s dark vale

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yet will I fear no ill

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
For thou art with me, and thy rod

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And staff me comfort still.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
For thou art with me, and thy rod

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And staff me comfort still.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
My table thou has furnished

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
In presence of my foes;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
My head thou dost with oil anoint

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And my cup overflows.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
My head thou dost with oil anoint

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And my cup overflows.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Goodness and mercy all my life

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Shall surely follow me,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And in God’s house for evermore

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
My dwelling-place shall be.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And in God’s house for evermore

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
My dwelling-place shall be.
