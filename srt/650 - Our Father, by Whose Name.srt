00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Our Father,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
by whose name,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Who dost in love proclaim

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Each family Thine own,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Bless Thou all parents,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
guarding well,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
With constant love as sentinel,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The homes in which Thy people dwell.

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
2

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
O Christ,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thyself a child

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Within an earthly home,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Our children bless, in every place,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That they may all behold Thy face,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And knowing Thee may grow in grace.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
O Spirit,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
who dost bind

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Our hearts in unity,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Who teaches us to find

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The love from self set free,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That every home, by this release,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
May be dwelling place of peace.
