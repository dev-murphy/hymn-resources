1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Dear Lord and Father of mankind,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
forgive our foolish ways;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
reclothe us in our rightful mind,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
in purer lives thy service find,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
in deeper reverence, praise.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In simple trust like theirs who heard,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
beside the Syrian sea,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the gracious calling of the Lord,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
let us, like them, without a word,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
rise up and follow thee.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
O sabbath rest by Galilee,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
O calm of hills above,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
where Jesus knelt to share with thee

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the silence of eternity,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
interpreted by love!

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Drop thy still dews of quietness,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
till all our strivings cease;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
take from our souls the strain and stress,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and let our ordered lives confess

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the beauty of thy peace.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Breathe through the heats of our desire

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
thy coolness and thy balm;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire,

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
O still, small voice of calm.
