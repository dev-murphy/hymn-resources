1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now let us from this table rise

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Renewed in body, mind, and soul;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
With Christ we die and live again,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
His selfless love has made us whole.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
With minds alert, upheld by grace,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To spread the word in speech and deed,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We follow in the steps of Christ,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
At one with all in hope and need.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
To fill each human house with love,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It is the sacrament of care;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The work that Christ began to do

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We humbly pledge ourselves to share.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Then grant us courage, Father God,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To choose again the pilgrim way

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And help us to accept with joy

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The challenge of tomorrow’s day.
