1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And cast a wishful eye

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
To Canaan’s fair and happy land,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Where my possessions lie.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I am bound for the promised land,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I am bound for the promised land;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O who will come and go with me?

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O’er all those wide extended plain

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Shines one eternal day;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There, Christ, the Sun, for ever reigns,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And scatters night away.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I am bound for the promised land,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O who will come and go with me?

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I am bound for the promised land.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When shall I reach that happy place,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And be forever blest?

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
When shall I see my Father’s face,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And in His kingdom rest?

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I am bound for the promised land,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
O who will come and go with me?

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I am bound for the promised land.

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Filled with delight, my raptured soul

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Would here no longer stay;

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Though Jordan’s waves around me roll,

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Fearless I’d launch away.

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I am bound for the promised land,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I am bound for the promised land;

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
O who will come and go with me?

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I am bound for the promised land.
