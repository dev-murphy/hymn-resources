1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The first noel the angel did say

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
On a cold winter’s night that was so deep.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Born is the King of Israel

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They looked up and say a star

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Shining in the east, beyond them far,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And to the earth it gave great light,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And so it continued both day and night.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And by the light of that same star,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Three wise men came from country far,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And to the earth it gave great light,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And to follow the star wherever it went.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This star drew nigh to the northwest,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
O’er Bethlehem it took its rest,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And there it did both stop and stay,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Then entered in those wise men three,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Full reverently upon the knee,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And offered there, in His presence,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.
