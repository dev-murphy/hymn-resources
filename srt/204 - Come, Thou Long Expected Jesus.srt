1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come, thou long expected Jesus!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
born to set thy people free;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
from our fears and sins release us,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
let us find our rest in thee.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Israel’s strength and consolation,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
hope of all the earth thou art;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
dear desire of every nation,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
joy of every longing heart.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Born thy people to deliver,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
born a child and yet a King,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
born to reign in us forever,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
now thy gracious kingdom bring.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
By thine own eternal spirit

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
rule in all our hearts alone;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
by thine all sufficient merit,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
raise us to thy glorious throne.
