1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
God, be merciful to me,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
On Thy grace I rest my plea;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Plenteous in compassion Thou,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Blot out my transgressions now;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Wash me, make me pure within,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Cleanse, O cleanse me from my sin,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Wash me, make me pure within,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Cleanse, O cleanse me from my sin.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I am evil, born in sin;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thou desirest truth within.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thou alone my Savior art,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Teach Thy wisdom to my heart;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Make me pure, Thy grace bestow,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Wash me whiter than the snow,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Make me pure, Thy grace bestow,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Wash me whiter than the snow.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Gracious God, my heart renew,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Make my spirit right and true;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Cast me not away from Thee,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Let Thy Spirit dwell in me;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thy salvation’s joy impart,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Steadfast make my willing heart,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Thy salvation’s joy impart,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Steadfast make my willing heart.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Sinners then shall learn from me

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And return, O God, to Thee;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Savior, all my guilt remove,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And my tongue shall sing Thy love;

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Touch my silent lips, O Lord,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And my mouth shall praise accord,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Touch my silent lips, O Lord,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And my mouth shall praise accord.
