1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Once to every man and nation, comes the moment to decide,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In the strife of truth with falsehood, for the good or evil side;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Some great cause, some great decision, offering each the bloom or blight,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And the choice goes by forever, ’twixt that darkness and that light.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Then to side with truth is noble, when we share her wretched crust,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Ere her cause bring fame and profit, and ’tis prosperous to be just;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Then it is the brave man chooses while the coward stands aside,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Till the multitude make virtue of the faith they had denied.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
By the light of burning martyrs, Christ, Thy bleeding feet we track,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Toiling up new Calv’ries ever with the cross that turns not back;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
New occasions teach new duties, time makes ancient good uncouth,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
They must upward still and onward, who would keep abreast of truth.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Though the cause of evil prosper, yet the truth alone is strong;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Though her portion be the scaffold, and upon the throne be wrong;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yet that scaffold sways the future, and behind the dim unknown,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above His own.
