1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lift high the cross, the love of Christ proclaim,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Till all the world adore His sacred Name.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Come, Christians, follow where our Captain trod,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Our King victorious, Christ, the Son of God.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Led on their way by this triumphant sign,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The hosts of God in conquering ranks combine.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
All newborn soldiers of the Crucified

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Bear on their brows the seal of Him Who died.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O Lord, once lifted on the glorious tree,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
As Thou hast promised, draw us all to Thee.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So shall our song of triumph ever be:

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Praise to the Crucified for victory!
