1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Break forth, O beauteous heavenly light,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And usher in the morning;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Ye shepherds, shrink not with affright,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But hear the angel’s warning.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This Child, now weak in infancy,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Our confidence and joy shall be,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The power of Satan breaking,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Our peace eternal making.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Break forth, O beauteous heavenly light,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To herald our salvation;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He stoops to earth – the God of might,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Our hope and expectation.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He comes in human flesh to dwell,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Our God with us, Immanuel,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The night of darkness ending,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Our fallen race befriending.
