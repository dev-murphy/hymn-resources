1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What a fellowship, what a joy divine,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
leaning on the everlasting arms;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
what a blessedness, what a peace is mine,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
leaning on the everlasting arms.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Leaning, leaning,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
safe and secure from all alarms;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
leaning, leaning,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
leaning on the everlasting arms.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
leaning on the everlasting arms;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
O how bright the path grows from day to day,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
leaning on the everlasting arms.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What have I to dread, what have I to fear,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
leaning on the everlasting arms?

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I have blessed peace with my Lord so near,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
leaning on the everlasting arms.
