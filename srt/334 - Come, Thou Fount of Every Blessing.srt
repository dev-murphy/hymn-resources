1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come, thou Fount of every blessing,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Tune my heart to sing thy grace;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Call for songs of loudest praise.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Teach me ever to adore Thee,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
May I still Thy goodness prove,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
While the hope of endless glory

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Fills my heart with joy and love.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Here I raise mine Ebenezer;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hither by thy help I’ve come;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And I hope, by thy good pleasure,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Safely to arrive at home.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Jesus sought me when a stranger,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Wandering from the fold of God;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He, to rescue me from danger,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Interposed his precious blood.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O, to grace how great a debtor

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Daily I’m constrained to be!

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let thy goodness, like a fetter,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Bind me closer still to thee.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Prone to leave the God I love;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Here’s my heart–O, take and seal it,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Seal it for thy courts above.
