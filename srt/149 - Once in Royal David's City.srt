1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Once in royal David’s city

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Stood a lowly cattle shed,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Where a mother laid her Baby

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In a manger for His bed;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Mary was that mother mild,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Jesus Christ her little Child.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He came down to earth from heaven,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Who is God and Lord of all,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And His shelter was a stable,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And His cradle was a stall;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
With the poor, and mean, and lowly,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Lived on earth our Savior holy.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And through all His wondrous childhood

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He would honor and obey,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Love and watch the lowly mother

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
In whose gentle arms He lay.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Christian children all must be

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Mild, obedient, good as He.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And our eyes at last shall see Him,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Through His own redeeming love;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
For that Child so dear and gentle

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Is our Lord in heaven above;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And He leads His children on

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
To the place where He is gone.
