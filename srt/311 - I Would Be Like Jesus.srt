1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Earthly pleasures vainly call me;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I would be like Jesus;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Nothing worldly shall enthrall me;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I would be like Jesus.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Be like Jesus, this my song,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In the home and in the throng;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Be like Jesus, all day long!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I would be like Jesus.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He has broken every fetter,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I would be like Jesus;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That my soul may serve Him better,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I would be like Jesus.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All the way from earth to glory,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I would be like Jesus;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Telling o’er and o’er the story,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I would be like Jesus.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That in Heaven He may meet me,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I would be like Jesus;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That His words “Well done” may greet me,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I would be like Jesus.
