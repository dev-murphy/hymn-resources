1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What joy it is to worship here,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And find ourselves at home,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Where God, who uses every gift,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Has room for all who come!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yet are no two of us alike

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Of all the human race,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And we must seek a common ground

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If we would share His grace.
