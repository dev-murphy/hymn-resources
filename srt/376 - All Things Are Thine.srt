1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
All things are Thine; no gift have we,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Lord of all gifts, to offer Thee;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And hence with grateful hearts today,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thine own before Thy feet we lay.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thy will was in the builder’s thought;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thy hand unseen amidst us wrought;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thro’ mortal motive, scheme and plan,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thy wise, eternal purpose ran.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No lack Thy perfect fullness knew;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
For human needs and longings grew

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This house of prayer- this home of rest.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Here may Thy saints be often blessed.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In weakness and in want we call

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
On Thee, for whom the heav’ns are small;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thy glory is Thy children’s good,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thy joy Thy tender Fatherhood.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O Father! deign these walls to bless;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Make this the abode of righteousness,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And let these doors a gateway be

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
To lead us from ourselves to Thee!
