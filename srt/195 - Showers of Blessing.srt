1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
“There shall be showers of blessing;”

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is the promise of love;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There shall be seasons refreshing,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sent from the Savior above.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Showers of blessing,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Showers of blessing we need;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Mercy drops round us are falling,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But for the showers we plead.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
“There shall be showers of blessing;”

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Precious reviving again;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Over the hills and the valleys,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Sound of abundance of rain.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
“There shall be showers of blessing;”

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Send them upon us, O Lord;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Grant to us now a refreshing;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Come, and now honor Thy word.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
“There shall be showers of blessing;”

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
O that today they might fall,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Now as to God we’re confessing,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Now as on Jesus we call!
