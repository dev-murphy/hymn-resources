1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus, Friend of little children,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Be a friend to me;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Take my hand and ever keep me

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Close to Thee.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Teach me how to grow in goodness,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Daily as I grow;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thou hast been a child, and surely

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thou dost know.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Step by step, O, lead me onward,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Upward into youth;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Wiser, stronger, still becoming

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In Thy truth.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Never leave me, nor forsake me;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Ever be my friend;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
For I need Thee from life’s dawning

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
To its end.
