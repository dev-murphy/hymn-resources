1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O love of God most full,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
O love of God most free,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Come warm my heart, come fill my soul,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Come lead me unto Thee.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Warm as the glowing sun

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So shines Thy love on me,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It wraps me ‘round with kindly care,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It draws me unto Thee.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The wildest sea is calm,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The tempest brings no fear,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The darkest night is full of light,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Because Thy love is near.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O love of God most full,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
O love of God most free,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It warms my heart, it fills my soul,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
With might it strengthens me.
