1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Seek ye first the kingdom,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
‘Tis your Father’s will.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So the voice of Jesus bids us follow still.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Saviour, we would hear Thee,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Follow, find, and see;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And in life’s adventure Thy disciples be.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
As for hidden treasure,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Or for matchless pearl,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
When at last discovered,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
some will sell their all;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So, when breaks the vision of that

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
kingdom fair,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Ours shall be its riches And its beauty rare.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
As the silent leaven works its secret way,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Or as grows the seed grain

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
through the night and day;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Lord, so be the increase, peaceable but sure,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Of Thy word within us,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And Thy kingdom’s power.

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
As the tender seedling grows up

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
tall and strong,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And the birds of heaven to its

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
branches throng; So shall all God’s children,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
from the east and west,

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Gather to His kingdom, In its shadow rest.

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Humblest shall be greatest,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
poor in spirit reign;

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Home shall come the childlike,

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
born through Thee again;

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Eager hearts arrive there on the

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
pilgrim’s road,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Hail! The kingdom glorious of the living God!
