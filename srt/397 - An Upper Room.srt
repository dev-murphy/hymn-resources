1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
An upper room did our Lord prepare

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For those loved until the end:

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And His disciples still gather there,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To celebrate their risen Friend.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And after supper He washed their feet,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For service, too, is sacrament.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
In Him our joy shall be made complete

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Sent out to serve, as He was sent.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
A lasting gift Jesus gave His own:

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To share His bread, His loving cup.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Whatever burdens may bow us down,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He by His cross shall lift us up.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No end there is! we depart in peace.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He loves beyond our uttermost:

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In every room in our Father’s house,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He will be there, as Lord and host.
