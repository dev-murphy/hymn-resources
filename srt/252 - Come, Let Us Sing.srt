1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come, let us sing the song of songs-

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The angels first began the strain-

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The homage which to Christ belongs:

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Slain to redeem us by His blood,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To cleanse from every sinful stain,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And make us kings and priests to God:

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
To Him who suffered on the tree,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Our souls, at His soul’s price, to gain,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Blessing, and praise, and glory be:

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
To Him, enthroned by filial right

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
All power in heaven and earth proclaim,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Honor, and majesty, and might:

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Long as we live, and when we die,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And while in heaven with Him we reign,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This song our song of songs shall be:

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”
