1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
May the grace of Christ our Savior

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And the Father’s boundless love,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
With the Holy Spirit’s favor,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Rest upon them from above.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thus may they abide in union

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
With each other and the Lord,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And possess, in sweet communion,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Joys which earth cannot afford.
