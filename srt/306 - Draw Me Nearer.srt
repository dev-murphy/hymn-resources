1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I am thine, O Lord, I have heard thy voice,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and it told thy love to me;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
but I long to rise in the arms of faith

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and be closer drawn to thee.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
to the cross where thou hast died.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to thy precious, bleeding side.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Consecrate me now to thy service, Lord,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
by the power of grace divine;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and my will be lost in thine.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O the pure delight of a single hour

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that before thy throne I spend,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
when I kneel in prayer, and with thee, my God,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I commune as friend with friend!
