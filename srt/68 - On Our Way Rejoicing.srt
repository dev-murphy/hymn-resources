1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
On our way rejoicing

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Gladly let us go;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Conquer’d hath our Leader,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Vanquish’d is the foe.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Christ without, our safety;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Christ within, our joy;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Who, if we be faithful,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Can our hope destroy?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
On our way rejoicing

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
As we forward move,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hearken to our praises,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
O blest God of love!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Unto God the Father

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Joyful songs we sing,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Unto God the Savior

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thankful hearts we bring,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Unto God the Spirit

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Bow we and adore,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
On our way rejoicing

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Now and evermore.
