1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Don’t forget the Sabbath,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The Lord our God hath blest,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Of all the week the brightest,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Of all the week the best;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It brings repose from labor,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It tells of joy divine,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Its beams of light descending,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
With heavenly beauty shine.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Welcome, welcome, ever welcome,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Blessed Sabbath day,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Welcome, welcome, ever welcome,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Blessed Sabbath day.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Keep the Sabbath holy,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And worship Him today,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Who said to His disciples,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
“I am the living way;”

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And if we meekly follow

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Our Savior here below,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He’ll give us of the fountain

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Whose streams eternal flow.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Day of sacred pleasure!

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Its golden hours we’ll spend

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
In thankful hymns to Jesus,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The children’s dearest Friend;

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
O gentle loving, Savior,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
How good and kind Thou art,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
How precious is Thy promise

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
To dwell in every heart!
