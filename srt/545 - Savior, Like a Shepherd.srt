in thy pleasant pastures feed us,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
for our use thy folds prepare.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thou hast bought us, thine we are.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus!

We are thine, thou dost befriend us,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
keep thy flock, from sin defend us,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
seek us when we go astray.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000

00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Hear, O hear us when we pray.

Thou hast promised to receive us,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
poor and sinful though we be;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
thou hast mercy to relieve us,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
grace to cleanse and power to free.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus!

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We will early turn to thee.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus!

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We will early turn to thee.
