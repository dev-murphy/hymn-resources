1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Bow down before Him, His glory proclaim;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
With gold of obedience, and incense of lowliness,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Kneel and adore Him: the Lord is His name.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Low at His feet lay thy burden of carefulness,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
High on His heart He will bear it for thee,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Comfort thy sorrows, and answer thy prayerfulness,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Guiding thy steps as may best for thee be.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Fear not to enter His courts in the slenderness

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Of the poor wealth thou wouldst reckon as thine;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Truth in its beauty, and love in its tenderness,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
These are the offerings to lay on His shrine.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
These, though we bring them in trembling and fearfulness,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He will accept for the name that is dear;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Mornings of joy give for evenings of tearfulness,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Trust for our trembling, and hope for our fear.
