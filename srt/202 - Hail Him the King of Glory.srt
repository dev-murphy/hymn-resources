1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Tell it to every kindred and nation,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Tell it far and near;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Earth’s darkest night will fade with the dawning,

00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Jesus will soon appear.

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hail Him the King of glory,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Once the Lamb for sinners slain;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Tell, tell the wondrous story,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
“Jesus comes to reign.”

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Nations again in strife and commotion,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Warnings by the way;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Signs in the heavens, unerring omens,

00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Herald the glorious day.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Children of God look up with rejoicing;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Shout and sing His praise;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Blessèd are they who, waiting and watching,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Look for the dawning rays.
