1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I would be, dear Savior, wholly Thine;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Teach me how, teach me how;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I would do Thy will, O Lord, not mine;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Help me, help me now.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Wholly Thine, wholly Thine,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Wholly Thine, this is my vow;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Wholly Thine, wholly Thine,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Wholly Thine, O Lord, just now.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What is worldly pleasure, wealth or fame,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Without Thee, without Thee?

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I will leave them all for Thy dear Name,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This my wealth shall be.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
As I cast earth’s transient joys behind,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Come Thou near, come Thou near;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In Thy presence all in all I find,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
’Tis my comfort here.
