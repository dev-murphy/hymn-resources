1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O soul, are you weary and troubled?

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No light in the darkness you see?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There’s light for a look at the Savior,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And life more abundant and free!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Look full in His wonderful face,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In the light of His glory and grace.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Through death into life everlasting

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He passed, and we follow Him there;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Over us sin no more hath dominion—

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
For more than conquerors we are!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
His Word shall not fail you—He promised;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Believe Him, and all will be well:

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then go to a world that is dying,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
His perfect salvation to tell!
