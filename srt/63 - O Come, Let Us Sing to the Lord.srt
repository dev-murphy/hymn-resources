1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O come, let us sing to the Lord,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Come let us every one

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
A joyful noise make to the Rock

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Of our salvation.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let us before His presence come

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
With glad and thankful voice;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let us sing psalms of praise to Him,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And make a joyful noise.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
For God, a great God and great King,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Above all gods, He is;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The depths of earth are in His hand,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The strength of hills is His.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
To Him the ocean vast belongs,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
For He the sea did make;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The dry land also from His hands,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Its form at first did take.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O come, bow down and worship Him,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And kneeling, humbly pray,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Come to our Maker and our God,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And hear His voice today.
