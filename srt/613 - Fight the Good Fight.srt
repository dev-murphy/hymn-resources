1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Fight the good fight with all thy might;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Christ is thy strength, and Christ thy right;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Lay hold on life and it shall be

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thy joy and crown eternally.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Run the straight race through God’s good grace;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Life with its path before us lies;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Christ is the way, and Christ the prize.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Cast care aside, lean on thy guide,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
His boundless mercy will provide;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Trust, and the trusting soul shall prove

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Christ is its life, and Christ its love.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Faint not, nor fear, His arms are near;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He changeth not, and thou art dear.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Only believe, and thou shalt see

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That Christ is all in all to thee.
