1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There is a green hill far away,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Without a city wall,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Where the dear Lord was crucified,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Who died to save us all.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We may not know, we cannot tell,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What pains He had to bear,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But we believe it was for us

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He hung and suffered there.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He died that we might be forgiven,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He died to make us good,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That we might go at last to heaven,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Saved by His precious blood.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There was no other good enough

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To pay the price of sin;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He only could unlock the gate

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Of heaven, and let us in.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O dearly, dearly has He loved!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And we must love Him too,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And trust in His redeeming blood,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And try His works to do.
