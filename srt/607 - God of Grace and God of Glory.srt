1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
God of grace and God of glory,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
On Thy people pour Thy power;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now fulfill Thy church’s story,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Bring her bud to glorious flower.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For the facing of this hour.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Lo, the hosts of evil round us

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Scorn Thy Christ, assail His ways;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
From the fears that long have bound us

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Free our hearts to faith and praise.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
For the facing of this hour.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Cure Thy children’s warring madness,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Bend our pride to Thy control;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Shame our wanton selfish gladness

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Rich in goods and poor in soul.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Lest we miss Thy kingdom’s goal.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Set our feet on lofty places,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Gird our lives that they may be

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Armored with all Christ-like graces

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In the fight to set all free.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That we fail not man nor Thee.
