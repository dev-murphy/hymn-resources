1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Fruitful trees, the Spirit’s sowing,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
May we ripen and increase,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Fruit to life eternal growing,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Rich in love and joy and peace.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Laden branches freely bearing

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Gifts the Giver loves to bless;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Here is fruit that grows by sharing,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Patience, kindness, gentleness.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Rooted deep in Christ, our Master,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Christ, our pattern and our goal,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Teach us, as the years fly faster,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Goodness, faith, and self control.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Fruitful trees, the Spirit’s tending,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
May we grow till harvests cease;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Till we taste, in life unending,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Heaven’s love and joy and peace.
