1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Christ, whose glory fills the skies,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Christ, the true, the only light,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sun of Righteousness, arise,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
triumph o’er the shades of night;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Dayspring from on high, be near;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Daystar, in my heart appear.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Dark and cheerless is the morn

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
unaccompanied by thee;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
joyless is the day’s return,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
till thy mercy’s beams I see;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
till they inward light impart,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
cheer my eyes and warm my heart.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Visit then this soul of mine;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
pierce the gloom of sin and grief;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
fill me, Radiancy divine,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
scatter all my unbelief;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
more and more thyself display,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
shining to the perfect day.
