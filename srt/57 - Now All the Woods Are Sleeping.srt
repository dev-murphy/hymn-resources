1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now all the woods are sleeping,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And night and stillness creeping

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
O’er city, man, and beast;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But thou, my heart, awake thee,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
To pray’r awhile be take thee,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And praise thy Maker ere thou rest.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
My Jesus, stay Thou by me,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And let no foe come nigh me,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Safe sheltered by Thy wing;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But would the foe alarm me,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
O let him never harm me,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But still Thine angels round me sing!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
My loved ones, rest securely,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
From every peril surely

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Our God will guard your heads;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And happy slumbers send you,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And bid His hosts attend you,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And golden armed watch o’er your beds.
