1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When the church of Jesus shuts its outer door,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Lest the roar of traffic drown the voice of prayer:

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
May our prayers, Lord make up ten times more aware

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That the world we banish is our Christian care.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If our hearts are lifted where devotion soars

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
High above this hungry suffering world of ours:

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Lest our hymns should drug us to forget its needs,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Forge our Christian worship into Christian deeds.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lest the gifts we offer, money, talents, time,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Serve to salve our conscience to our secret shame:

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Lord, reprove, inspire us by the way you give;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Teach us, dying Savior, how true Christians live.
