1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Christ is made the sure foundation,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Christ the head and cornerstone,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
chosen of the Lord, and precious,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
binding all the Church in one;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
holy Zion’s help for ever,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and her confidence alone.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
All that dedicated city,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
dearly loved of God on high,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
in exultant jubilation

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
pours perpetual melody;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
God the One in Three adoring

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
in glad hymns eternally.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
To this temple, where we call thee,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
come, O Lord of Hosts, today;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
with thy wonted loving-kindness

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
hear thy servants as they pray,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and thy fullest benediction

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
shed within its walls alway.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Here vouchsafe to all thy servants

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
what they ask of thee of gain;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
what they gain from thee, for ever

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
with the blessèd to retain,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and hereafter in thy glory

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
evermore with thee to reign.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Laud and honor to the Father,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
laud and honor to the Son,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
laud and honor to the Spirit,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
ever Three, and ever One,

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
con-substantial, co-eternal,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
while unending ages run.
