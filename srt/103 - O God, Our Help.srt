1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O God, our help in ages past,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
our hope for years to come,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
our shelter from the stormy blast,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and our eternal home!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Under the shadow of thy throne,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
still may we dwell secure;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
sufficient is thine arm alone,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and our defense is sure.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Before the hills in order stood,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
or earth received her frame,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
from everlasting, thou art God,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to endless years the same.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
A thousand ages, in thy sight,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
are like an evening gone;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
short as the watch that ends the night,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
before the rising sun.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O God, our help in ages past,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
our hope for years to come;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
be thou our guide while life shall last,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and our eternal home!
