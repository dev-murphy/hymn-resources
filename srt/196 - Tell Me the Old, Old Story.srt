1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Tell me the old, old story of unseen things above,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Of Jesus and His glory, of Jesus and His love.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Tell me the story simply, as to a little child,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For I am weak and weary, and helpless and defiled.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Tell me the old, old story, tell me the old, old story,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Tell me the old, old story, of Jesus and His love.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Tell me the story softly, with earnest tones and grave;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Remember I’m the sinner whom Jesus came to save.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Tell me the story always, if you would really be,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In any time of trouble, a comforter to me.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Tell me the same old story when you have cause to fear

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That this world’s empty glory is costing me too dear.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes, and when that world’s glory is dawning on my soul,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Tell me the old, old story: “Christ Jesus makes thee whole.”
