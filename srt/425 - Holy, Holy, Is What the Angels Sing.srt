1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There is singing up in heaven

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
such as we have never known,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Where the angels sing the praises

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
of the Lamb upon the throne;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Their sweet harps are ever tuneful

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and their voices are always clear,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O that we might be more like them

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
while we serve the Master here!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Holy, holy, is what the angels sing,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And I expect to help them make

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the courts of heaven ring;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But when I sing redemption’s story,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
they will fold their wings,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
For angels never felt the joys

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
that our salvation brings.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But I hear another anthem,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
blending voices clear and strong,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
“Unto Him who hath redeemed us

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and hath bought us,” is the song;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We have come thro’ tribulations

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
to this land so fair and bright,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In the fountain freely flowing

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He hath made our garments white.

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Then the angels stand and listen,

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
for they cannot join that song,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Like the sound of many waters,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
by that happy, blood-washed throng;

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
For they sing about great trials,

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
battles fought and vict’ries won,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And they praised the great Redeemer,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
who hath said to them, “Well done.”

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So, although I’m not an angel,

33
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:15,000
yet I know that over there

34
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I will join a blessed chorus

35
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:45,000
that the angels cannot share;

36
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I will sing about my Savior,

37
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:15,000
who upon dark Calvary

38
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Freely pardoned my transgressions,

39
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:45,000
died to set the sinner free.
