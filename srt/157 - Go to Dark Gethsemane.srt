1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Go to dark Gethsemane,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Ye who feel the tempter’s power

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Your Redeemer’s conflict see.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Watch with him one bitter hour;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Turn not from his griefs away;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Learn from Jesus Christ to pray.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
See Him at the judgment hall,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Beaten, bound, reviled, arraigned;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
See Him meekly bearing all;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Love to man His soul sustained!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Learn from him to bear the cross.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Calvary’s mournful mountain climb;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There, adoring at his feet,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Mark that miracle of time,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
God’s own sacrifice complete.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
“It is finished!” hear him cry;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Learn from Jesus Christ to die.
