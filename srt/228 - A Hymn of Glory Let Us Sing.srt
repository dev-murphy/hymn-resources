1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A hymn of glory let us sing;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
New hymns thro’-out the world shall ring

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Alleluia! Alleluia!

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Christ, by a road before untrod,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Ascends unto the throne of God.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Alleluia! Alleluia!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O Lord, our homeward pathway bend,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That our unwearied hearts ascend.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Alleluia! Alleluia!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Where, seated on Your Father’s throne,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You reign as King of kings alone.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Alleluia! Alleluia!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Give us Your joy on earth, O Lord,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
In heav’n to be our great reward.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Alleluia! Alleluia!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
When throned with You forever, we

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Shall praise Your name eternally.

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Alleluia! Alleluia!

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
O risen Christ, ascended Lord,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
All praise to you let earth accord:

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Alleluia! Alleluia!

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You are, while endless ages run,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
With Father and with Spirit one.

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Alleluia! Alleluia!

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
