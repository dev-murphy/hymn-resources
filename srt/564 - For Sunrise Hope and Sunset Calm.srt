1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
For sunrise hope and sunset calm, and all that lies between,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For all the sweetness and the balm that is and that has been,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For comradeship for peace in strife, and light on darkened days;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For work to do and strength for life we sing our hymn of praise.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But O, we press far, far above these gifts of pure delight,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And find in Thee, and in Thy love contentment infinite.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O Lord, beloved, in whom are found all joys of time and place,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What will it be when joy is crowned by vision of Thy face?
