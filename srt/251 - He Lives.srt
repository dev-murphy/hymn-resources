1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I serve a risen Savior,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He’s in the world today;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I know that He is living,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
whatever men may say;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I see His hand of mercy,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I hear His voice of cheer

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And just the time

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I need Him He’s always near.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He lives, He lives,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Christ Jesus lives today!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He walks with me

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and talks with me

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
along life’s narrow way.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He lives, He lives,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
salvation to impart!

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You ask me how I know He lives?

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He lives within my heart.

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In all the world around me

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I see His loving care,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And tho’ my heart grows weary

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I never will despair;

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I know that He is leading

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
thru all the stormy blast,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The day of His appearing

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
will come at last.

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Rejoice, rejoice, O Christian,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
lift up your voice and sing,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Eternal hallelujahs

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
to Jesus Christ the King!

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The hope of all who seek Him,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
the help of all who find,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
None other is so loving,

33
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:15,000
so good and kind.
