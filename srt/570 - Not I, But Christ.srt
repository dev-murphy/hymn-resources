1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Not I, but Christ, be honored, loved, exalted;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Not I, but Christ, be seen, be known, be heard;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Not I, but Christ, in every look and action,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Not I, but Christ, in every thought and word.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Not I, but Christ, to gently soothe in sorrow,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Not I, but Christ, to wipe the falling tear;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Not I, but Christ, to lift the weary burden,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Not I, but Christ, to hush away all fear.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Christ, only Christ! No idle words e’er falling,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Christ, only Christ; no needless bustling sound;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Christ, only Christ, no self important bearing;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Christ, only Christ, no trace of “I” be found.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Not I, but Christ, my every need supplying,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Not I, but Christ, my strength and health to be;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Christ, only Christ, for body, soul, and spirit,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Christ, only Christ, here and eternally.
