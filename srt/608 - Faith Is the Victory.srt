1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Encamped along the hills of light,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Ye Christian soldiers, rise,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And press the battle ere the night

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Shall veil the glowing skies.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Against the foe in vales below,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let all our strength be hurled;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Faith is the victory, we know,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That overcomes the world.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Faith is the victory!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Faith is the victory!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, glorious victory

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That overcomes the world.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
His banner over us in love,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Our sword the Word of God;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We tread the road the saints above

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
With shouts of triumph trod.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
By faith they, like whirlwind’s breath,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Swept on o’er ev’ry field;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The faith by which they conquered death

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Is still our shining shield.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
To him who overcomes the foe

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
White raiment shall be giv’n;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Before the angels he shall know

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
His name confessed in heav’n.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Then onward from the hills of light,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Our hearts with love aflame;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
We’ll vanquish all the hosts of night,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
In Jesus’ conq’ring name.
