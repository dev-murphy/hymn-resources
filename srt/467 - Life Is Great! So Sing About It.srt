1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Life is great! So sing about it,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
As we can and as we should-

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Shop and buses, towns and people,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Village, farmland, field and wood,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Life is great and life is given;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Life is lovely, free and good.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Life is great! What ever happens,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Snow or sunshine, joy or pain,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hardship, grief or disillusion,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Suffering that I can’t explain

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Life is great if someone loves me,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Holds my hand and calls my name.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Love is great! The love of lovers,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Whispered words and longing eyes;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Love that gazes at the cradle

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Where a child of loving lies;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Love that lasts when youth has faded,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Bends with age, but never dies.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Love is giving and receiving

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Boy and girl, or friend with friend;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Love is bearing and forgiving

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
All the hurts that hate can send;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Love’s the greatest way of living,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hoping, trusting to the end.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
God is great! in Christ He loved us,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
As we should, but never can-

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Love that suffered, hoped and trusted

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
When disciples turned and ran,

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Love that broke through death forever.

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Praise that loving, living Man!
