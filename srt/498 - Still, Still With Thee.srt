1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When the bird waketh, and the shadows flee;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Fairer than morning, lovelier than daylight,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Dawns the sweet consciousness, I am with Thee.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Alone with Thee, amid the mystic shadows,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The solemn hush of nature newly born;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Alone with Thee in breathless adoration,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In the calm dew and freshness of the morn.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Still, still with Thee! As to each newborn morning

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
A fresh and solemn splendor still is given,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So does this blessed consciousness, awaking,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Breathe each day nearness unto Thee and heaven.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So shall it be at last, in that bright morning,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
When the soul waketh and life’s shadows flee;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
O in that hour, fairer than daylight dawning,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Shall rise the glorious thought, I am with Thee.
