1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Watchman, blow the gospel trumpet,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Every soul a warning give;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Whosoever hears the message

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
May repent, and, turn and live.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Blow the trumpet, trusty watchman,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Blow it loud o’er land and sea;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
God commissions, sound the message!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Every captive may be free.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sound it loud oér every hilltop,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Gloomy shade and sunny plain;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Ocean depths repeat the message,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Full salvation’s glad refrain.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sound it in the hedge and highway,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Earth’s dark spots where exiles roam;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let it tell all things are ready,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Father waits to welcome home.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Sound it for the heavy laden,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Weary, longing to be free;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Sound a Savior’s invitation,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Sweetly saying, “Come to me.”
