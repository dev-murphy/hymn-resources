1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come, come, ye saints, no toil nor labor fear;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But with joy wend your way.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Grace shall be as your day.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We will have a living lord to guide,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And we can trust Him to provide;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Do this, and joy your hearts will swell:

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
All is well! All is well!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We’ll find the rest which God for us prepared,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
When at last He will call;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Where none will come to hurt or make afraid,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He will reign over all.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We will make the air with music ring,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Shout praise to God our Lord and King:

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
O how we’ll make the chorus swell:

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All is well! All is well!
