1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O safe to the Rock that is higher than I,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
My soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So sinful, so weary, Thine, Thine, would I be;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thou blest “Rock of Ages,” I’m hiding in Thee.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hiding in Thee, hiding in Thee,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thou blest “Rock of Ages,”

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I’m hiding in Thee.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In the calm of the noontide, in sorrow’s lone hour,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
In times when temptation casts over me its power;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In the tempests of life, on its wide, heaving sea,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thou blest “Rock of Ages,“ I’m hiding in Thee.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
How oft in the conflict, when pressed by the foe,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I have fled to my refuge and breathed out my woe;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
How often, when trials like sea billows roll,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul.
