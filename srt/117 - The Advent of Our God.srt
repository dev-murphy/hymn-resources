1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The advent of our God

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
With eager prayers we greet,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And singing haste upon His road

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
His coming reign to meet.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The everlasting Son

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Was born to make us free;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And He a servant’s form put on

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To gain our liberty.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
As Judge, on clouds of light,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He soon will come again,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
His scattered people to unite

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
With them in heaven to reign.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Praise to the incarnate Son

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Who comes to set us free,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
With Father, Spirit, ever one,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
To all eternity.
