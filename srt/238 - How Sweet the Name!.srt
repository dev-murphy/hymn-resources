1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In a believer’s ear!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And drives away his fear.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It makes the wounded spirit whole,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And calms the troubled breast;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
“Tis manna to the hungry soul,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And to the weary, rest.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Dear name, the rock on which I build,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My shield and hiding place,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My neverfailing treasury, filled

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
With boundless stores of grace.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Jesus! my Shepherd, Guardian, Friend,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
My Prophet, Priest, and King!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
My Lord, my life, my way, my end!

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Accept the praise I bring.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Weak is the effort of my heart,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And cold my warmest thought;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But when I see Thee as Thou art,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I’ll praise Thee as I ought.
