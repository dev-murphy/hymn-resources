1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Just as I am, without one plea,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but that thy blood was shed for me,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and that thou bidst me come to thee,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Just as I am, and waiting not

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
to rid my soul of one dark blot,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
to thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Just as I am, though tossed about

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
with many a conflict, many a doubt,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
fightings and fears within, without,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
sight, riches, healing of the mind,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
yea, all I need in thee to find,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Just as I am, thou wilt receive,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
because thy promise I believe,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Just as I am, thy love I own

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
hath broken every barrier down;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
now, to be thine, and thine alone,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
