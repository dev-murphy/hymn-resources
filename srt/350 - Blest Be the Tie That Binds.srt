1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Blest be the tie that binds

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
our hearts in Christian love;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the fellowship of kindred minds

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
is like to that above.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Before our Father’s throne

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
we pour our ardent prayers;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
our comforts and our cares.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We share each other’s woes,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
our mutual burdens bear;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and often for each other flows

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the sympathizing tear.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
When we asunder part,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
it gives us inward pain;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
but we shall still be joined in heart,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and hope to meet again.
