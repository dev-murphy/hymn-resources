1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When I can read my title clear

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To mansions in the skies

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I’ll bid farewell to every fear,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And wipe my weeping eyes;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And wipe my weeping eyes,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And wipe my weeping eyes,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I’ll bid farewell to every fear,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And wipe my weeping eyes.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Should earth against my soul engage,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And fiery darts be hurled,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Then I can smile at Satan’s rage,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And face a frowning world;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And face a frowning world,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And face a frowning world,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then I can smile at Satan’s rage,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And face a frowning world.
