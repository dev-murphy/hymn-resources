1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
More love to thee, O Christ, more love to thee!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hear thou the prayer I make on bended knee.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This is my earnest plea: More love, O Christ, to thee;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
more love to thee, more love to thee!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Once earthly joy I craved, sought peace and rest;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
now thee alone I seek, give what is best.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This all my prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to thee;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
more love to thee, more love to thee!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let sorrow do its work, come grief and pain;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
sweet are thy messengers, sweet their refrain,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
when they can sing with me: More love, O Christ, to thee;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
more love to thee, more love to thee!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Then shall my latest breath whisper thy praise;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
this be the parting cry my heart shall raise;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
this still its prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to thee;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
more love to thee, more love to thee!
