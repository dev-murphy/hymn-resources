00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let your heart be broken for a world in need:

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Feed the mouths that hunger, soothe the wounds that bleed,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Give the cup of water and the loaf of bread

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Be the hands of Jesus, serving in His stead.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Here on earth applying principles of love,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Visible expression – God still rules above

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Living illustration of the Living Word

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To the minds of all who’ve Never seen or heard.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Blest to be a blessing privileged to care,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Challenged by the need apparent everywhere.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Where mankind is wanting, fill the vacant place.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Be the means through which the Lord reveals His grace.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Add to your believing deeds that prove it true,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Knowing Christ as Savior, make Him Master, too.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Follow in His footsteps, go where He has trod;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
In the world’s great trouble risk yourself for God.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let your heart be tender and your vision clear;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
See mankind as God sees, serve Him far and near.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let your heart be broken by a brother’s pain;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Share your rich resources, give and give again.
