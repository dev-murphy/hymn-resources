1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
With songs and honors sounding loud,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Address the Lord on high;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Over the heavens He spreads His cloud,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And waters veil the sky.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He sends His showers of blessing down

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To cheer the plains below;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He makes the grass the mountains crown,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And corning valleys grow.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
His steady counsels change the face

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Of the declining year;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He bids the sun cut short his race,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And wintry days appear.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He sends His word, and melts the snow;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The fields no longer mourn;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He calls the warmer gales to blow,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And bids the spring return.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The changing wind, the flying cloud,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Obey His mighty word:

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
With songs and honors sounding loud

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Praise ye the sovereign Lord!
