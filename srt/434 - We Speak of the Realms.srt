1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We speak of the realms of the blest,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That country so bright and so fair,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And oft are its glories confessed-

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But what must it be to be there!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We speak of its pathway of gold-

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Its walls decked with jewels so rare,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Its wonders and pleasures untold-

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But what must it be to be there!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We speak of its freedom of sin,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
From sorrow, temptation and care,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
From trials without and within—

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But what must it be to be there!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We speak of its service of love,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Of the robes which glorified wear,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Of the church of the First Born above-

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But what must it be to be there!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Our mourning is all at an end,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
When, raised by the life-giving word,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We see the new city descend,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Adorned as a bride for her Lord;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The city so holy and clean,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No sorrow can breathe in the air;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No gloom of affliction or sin,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No shadow of evil, is there.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Do Thou, midst temptation and woe,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
For heaven my spirit prepare;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And shortly I also so shall know

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And feel what it is to be there.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Then o’er the bright fields we shall roam,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
In glory celestial and fair,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
With saints and with angels at home,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And Jesus Himself will be there.
