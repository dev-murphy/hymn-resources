1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
To the name that brings salvation

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let the nations bow the head;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let them kneel in adoration

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
When this name of names is said;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let them pray for restoration

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Of all things in Christ the head.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He through every generation

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Rules in endless majesty;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
May the kings of every nation

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now foreswear their enmity,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And with humble veneration

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In the love of God agree.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Lord, we pray for upright rulers:

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Guard them surely in their need

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
From the vanity of power

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And the emptiness of greed;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let them see the truth of lowness,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And on justice let them feed.
