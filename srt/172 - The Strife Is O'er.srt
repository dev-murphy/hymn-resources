1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The strife is o’er, the battle done;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now is the victor’s triumph won!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now be the song of praise begun. Alleluia!

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The pow’rs of death have done their worst,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But Christ their legions has dispersed.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let shouts of holy joy outburst. Alleluia!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The three sad days have quickly sped,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He rises glorious from the dead.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
All glory to our risen head! Alleluia!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Lord, by the stripes which wounded You,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
From death’s sting free Your servants too,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That we may live and sing to You. Alleluia!
