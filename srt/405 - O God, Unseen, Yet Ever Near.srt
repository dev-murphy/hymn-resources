1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O God, unseen, yet ever near,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Reveal Thy presence now

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
While we in love that hath no fear,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Before Thy glory bow.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Here may Thy faithful people know

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The blessings of Thy love,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The streams that thro’ the dessert flow,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The manna from above.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We come, obedient to Thy Word

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To feast on heav’nly food,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Our meat, the body of our Lord,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Our drink, His precious blood.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thus may we all Thy words obey,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
For we, O God, are Thine,
