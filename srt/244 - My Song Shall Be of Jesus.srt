1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My song shall be of Jesus;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
His mercy crowns my days,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He fills my cup with blessings,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And tunes my heart to praise.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
My song shall be of Jesus,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The precious Lamb of God,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Who gave Himself my ransom,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And bought me with His blood.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
My song shall be of Jesus

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When, sitting at His feet,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I call to mind His goodness

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In meditation sweet:

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
My song shall be of Jesus,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Whatever ill betide;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I’ll sing the grace that saves me,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And keeps me at His side.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
My song shall be of Jesus

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
While pressing on my way

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
To reach the blissful kingdom

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Of pure and perfect day:

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And when my soul shall enter

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That realm of splendor fair,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
A song of praise to Jesus

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I’ll sing forever there.
