1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
As saints of old their first fruits brought

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Of orchard, flock, and field

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
To God the giver all good,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The source of bounteous yield;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So we today first fruits would bring:

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The wealth of this good land,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Of farm and market, shop and home,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Of mind, and heart, and hand.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
A world in need now summons us

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To labor, love, and give;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
To make our life an offering

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To God, that all may live.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The Church of Christ is calling us

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To make the dream come true:

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
A world redeemed by Christ-like love;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
All life in Christ made new.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In gratitude and humble trust

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We bring our best today,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
To serve Your cause and share Your love

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
With all along life’s way.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
O God, who gave yourself to us

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In Jesus Christ Your Son,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Teach us to give ourselves each day

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Until life’s work is done.
