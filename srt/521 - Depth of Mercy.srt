1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Depth of mercy!–can there be

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Mercy still reserved for me?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Can my God His wrath forbear?

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Me, the chief of sinners, spare?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I have long withstood His grace,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Long provoked Him to His face,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Would not hearken to His calls,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Grieved Him by a thousand falls.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now incline me to repent;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let me now my sins lament;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Now my foul revolt deplore,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Weep, believe, and sin no more.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There for me the Savior stands,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Shows His wounds and spreads His hands;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
God is love! I know, I feel;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Jesus weeps, and loves me still.
