1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Watch, ye saints, with eyelids waking;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Lo! The powers of heaven are shaking;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Keep your lamps all trimmed an burning,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Ready for your Lord’s returning.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Lo! He comes, lo! Jesus comes;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Lo! He come, He comes all glorious!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Jesus comes to reign victorious,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Lo! He comes, yes, Jesus comes.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lo! the promise of your Savior,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Pardoned sin and purchased favor,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Blood-washed robes and crowns of glory;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Haste to tell redemption’s story.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Kingdoms at their base are crumbling,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hark! His chariot wheels are rumbling;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Tell, O tell of grace abounding,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
While the seventh trump is sounding.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Nations wane, though proud and stately;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Christ His kingdom hasteneth greatly;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Earth her latest pangs is summing;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Shout, ye saints, your Lord is coming.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Sinners, come, while Christ is pleading;

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Now for you He’s interceding;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Haste, ere grace and time diminished

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Shall proclaim the mystery finished.
