1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O sing my soul, your Maker’s praise

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In grateful hymns ascending;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Whose steadfast love has crowned your days

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
With heav’nly gifts un ending.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I sought the Lord, He heard my cry;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
His holy angels hover nigh

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The tents of those who love Him.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The Lord is good to those who seek

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
His face in time of sorrow,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Providing comfort to the weak

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And grace for each tomorrow.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Though grief may tarry for a night,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The morn shall break in joy and light

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
With blessings from His presence.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The Lord will turn His face in peace

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
When troubled souls draw near Him;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
His loving kindness shall not cease

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
To those who trust and fear Him.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Our God will not forsake His own;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Eternal is His heav’nly throne;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
His kingdom stands forever.
