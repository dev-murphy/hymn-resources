1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O Morning Star, how fair and bright!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You shine with God’s own truth and light,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Aglow with grace and mercy!

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Of Jacob’s race, King David’s son,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Our Lord and Master, You have won

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Our hearts to serve You only!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Lowly, holy!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Great and Glorious, all victorious,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Rich in blessing! Rule and might o’er all possessing!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Lord, when you look on us in love,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
At once there falls from God above

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
A ray of purest pleasure.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Your Word and Spirit, flesh and blood,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Refresh our souls with heav-‘nly food.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You are our dearest treasure!

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let Your mercy warm and cheer us!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O draw near us! For You teach us

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
God’s own love through You has reached us.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Almighty Father, in Your Son

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You loved us, when not yet begun

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Was this old earth’s foundation!

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Your Son has ransomed us in love

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
To live in Him here and above:

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This is Your great salvation.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Alleluia! Christ the living,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
To us giving life forever,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Keeps us Yours and fails us never!

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
O let the harps break forth in sound!

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Our joy be all with music crowned,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Our voices gaily blending!

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
For Christ goes with us all the way –

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Today, tomorrow, every day!

33
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:15,000
His love is never ending!

34
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Sing out! Ring out!

35
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Jubilation! Exultation!

36
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Tell the story!

37
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Great is He, the King of glory!
