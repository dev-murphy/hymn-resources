1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My heart can sing when I pause to remember,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A heartache here is but a stepping stone.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Along a trail, thats winding always upward,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This troubled world, is not my final home.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But until then, my heart will go on singing,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Until then, with joy I’ll carry on,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Until the day my eyes behold the city,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Until the day God calls me home.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The things of earth will dim and lose their value,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If we recall they’re borrowed for awhile;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And things of earth that cause the heart to tremble,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Remembered there, will only bring a smile.
