1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O Jesus, I have promised

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to serve thee to the end;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
be thou forever near me,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
my Master and my friend.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I shall not fear the battle

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
if thou art by my side,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
nor wander from the pathway

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
if thou wilt be my guide.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O let me feel thee near me!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The world is ever near;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I see the sights that dazzle,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the tempting sounds I hear;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
my foes are ever near me,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
around me and within;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
but Jesus, draw thou nearer,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and shield my soul from sin.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O Jesus, thou hast promised

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
to all who follow thee

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
that where thou art in glory

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
there shall thy servant be.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And Jesus, I have promised

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
to serve thee to the end;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
O give me grace to follow,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
my Master and my Friend.
