1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hark! the vesper hymn is stealing

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
O’er the waters soft and clear;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Jubilate, Jubilate, Jubilate,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Amen.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Nearer yet, and nearer pealing,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Soft it breaks upon the ear.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Jubilate, Jubilate, Jubilate,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Amen.
