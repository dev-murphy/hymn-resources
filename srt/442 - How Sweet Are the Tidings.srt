1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How sweet are the tidings that greet the pilgrim’s ear,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
As he wanders in exile from home!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Soon, soon will the Savior in glory appear,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And soon will the kingdom come.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He’s coming, coming, coming soon I know,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Coming back to this earth again;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And the weary pilgrims will to glory go,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
When the Savior comes to reign.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The mossy old graves where the pilgrims sleep

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Shall be open as wide as before,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And the millions that sleep in the mighty deep

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Shall live on this earth once more.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There we’ll meet ne’er to part in our happy

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Eden home, Sweet songs of redemption we’ll sing;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
From the north, from the south, all the ransomed shall come,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And worship our heavenly King.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hallelujah, Amen! Hallelujah again!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Soon, if faithful, we all shall be there;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
O, be watchful, be hopeful, be joyful till then,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And a crown of bright glory we’ll wear.
