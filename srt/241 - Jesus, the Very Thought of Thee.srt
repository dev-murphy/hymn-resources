1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus, the very thought of thee

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
with sweetness fills the breast;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
but sweeter far thy face to see,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and in thy presence rest.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No voice can sing, no heart can frame,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Nor can the memory find

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
A sweeter sound than Jesus’ name,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The Savior of mankind.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O hope of every contrite heart!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
O joy of all the meek,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
to those who fall, how kind thou art!

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
How good to those who seek!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But what to those who find? Ah, this

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
nor tongue nor pen can show;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
the love of Jesus, what it is,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
none but his loved ones know.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Jesus, our only joy be thou,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
as thou our prize wilt be;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Jesus, be thou our glory now,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and through eternity.
