1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Sound the battle cry,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
See! the foe is nigh;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Raise the standard high

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For the Lord;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Gird your armor on,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Stand firm, every one,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Rest your cause upon His holy word.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Rouse, then soldiers!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
rally round the banner!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Ready, steady, pass the word along;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Onward, forward, shout aloud hosanna!

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Christ is Captain of the mighty throng.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Strong to meet the foe,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Marching on we go,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
While our cause we know

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Must prevail;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Shield and banner bright,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Gleaming in the light,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Battling for the right,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We ne’er can fail.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
O Thou God of all,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Hear us when we call,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Help us, one and all,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
By Thy grace;

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
When the battle’s done,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And the victory won,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
May we wear the crown

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Before Thy face.
