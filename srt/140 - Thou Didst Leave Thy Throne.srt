1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Thou didst leave Thy throne

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And Thy kingly crown

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When Thou camest to earth for me;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But in Bethlehem’s home

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Was there found no room

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For Thy holy nativity.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There is room in my heart for Thee.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Heaven’s arches rang

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When the angels sang

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Proclaiming Thy royal degree;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But of lowly birth

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Didst Thou come to earth,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And in greatest humility.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The foxes found rest,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And the birds their nest

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In the shade of the forest tree;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But Thy couch was the sod,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
O Thou Son of God,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
In the deserts of Galilee.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thou camest, O Lord,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
With the living word

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That should set Thy people free;

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But with mocking scorn,

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And with crown of thorn,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
They bore Thee to Calvary.

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
When the heavens shall ring,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And the angels sing,

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
At Thy coming to victory,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Let Thy voice call me home,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Saying, “Yet there is room,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There is room at My side for thee.”

33
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:15,000
My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,

34
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:30,000
When Thou comest and callest for me.
