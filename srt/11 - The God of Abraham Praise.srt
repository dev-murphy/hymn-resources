1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The God of Abraham praise,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Who reigns enthroned above;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Ancient of everlasting days,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And God of love;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Jehovah! Great I AM!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
By earth and heaven confessed;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I bow and bless the sacred name,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Forever blest.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The God of Abraham praise,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
At whose supreme command

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
From earth I rise, and seek the joys

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
At His right hand;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I all on earth forsake,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Its wisdom, fame and power;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And Him my only portion make,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
My shield and tower.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The whole triumphant host

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Give thanks to God on high;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
“Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!”

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
They ever cry;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hail, Abraham’s God and mine!

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I join the heavenly lays;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
All might and majesty are Thine,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And endless praise.
