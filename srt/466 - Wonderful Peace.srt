1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Far away in the depths of my spirit tonight,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Rolls a melody sweeter than psalm;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In celestial like strains it unceasingly falls

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
O’er my soul like an infinite calm.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Peace! Peace! wonderful peace,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Coming down from the Father above;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In fathomless billows of love.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What a treasure I have in this wonderful peace,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Buried deep in my inner most soul,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So secure that no power can mine it away,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
While the years of eternity roll!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I believe when I rise to that city of peace,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Where the Author of peace I shall see,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That one strain of the song which the ransomed will sing,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
In that heavenly kingdom will be-

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Weary soul, without gladness or comfort or rest,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Passing down the rough pathway of time!

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Make the Savior your friend ere the shadows grow dark;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
O accept of this peace so sublime.
