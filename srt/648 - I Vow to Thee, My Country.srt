1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I vow to thee, my country, all earthly things above,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Entire and whole and perfect, the service of my love:

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The love that asks the reason, the love that stands the test,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That lays upon the altar the dearest and the best;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The love that never falters, the love that pays the price,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And there’s another country, I’ve heard of long ago,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We may not count her armies, we may not see her King;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And one by one and fervently we pray for her increase,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And her ways are ways of gentleness, and all her paths are peace.
