1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus, lover of my soul,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let me to thy bosom fly,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
While the billows near me roll,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
While the tempest still is high;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hide me, O my Savior, hide!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Till the storm of life is past;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Safe into the haven guide,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O receive my soul at last!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Other refuge has I none,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hangs my helpless soul on thee;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Leave O leave me not alone!

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Still support and comfort me;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All my trust on Thee is stayed,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
All my help from Thee I bring;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Cover my defenseless head

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
With the shadow of Thy wing.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thou, O Christ, all I want,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
More than all in Thee I find;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Heal the sick, and lead the blind.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Just and holy is Thy name,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I am all unrighteousness;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Vile and full of sin I am;

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Thou art full of truth and grace.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Plenteous grace with Thee is found-

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Grace to pardon all my sin;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let the healing streams abound,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Make and keep me pure within;

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Thou of life the Fountain art,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Freely let me take of Thee;

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Spring Thou up within my heart,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Rise to all eternity.
