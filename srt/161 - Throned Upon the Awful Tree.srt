1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Throned upon the awful tree,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Lamb of God, Your grief we see.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Darkness veils Your anguished face;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
None its lines of woe can trace.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
None can tell what pangs unknown

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hold You silent and alone.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Silent through those three dread hours,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Wrestling with the evil powers,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Left alone with human sin,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Gloom around You and within,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Till th’appointed time is nigh,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Till the Lamb of God may die.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Hark, that cry that peals aloud

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Upward through the whelming cloud!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You, the Father’s only Son,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You, His own anointed one,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You are asking- can it be?

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
“Why have You forsaken Me?”

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Lord, should fear and anguish roll

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Darkly o’er our sinful soul,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You, who once were thus bereft

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That Your own might ne’er be left,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Teach us by that bitter cry

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
In the gloom to know You nigh.
