1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come, sing a song of harvest, Of thanks for daily food!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To offer God the first-fruits is old as gratitude.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Long, long ago, the reapers, before they kept the feast,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Put first-fruits in a basket, and took it to the priest.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Shall we, sometimes forgetful oh where creation starts,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
With science in our pockets lose wonder from our hearts?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
May God, the great Creator, to whom all life belongs,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Accept these gifts we offer, our service and our songs.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And lest the world go hungry while we ourselves are fed,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Make each of us more ready to share our daily bread.
