There’s a star in the east on Christmas morn.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It will lead to the place and where the Saviour’s born,

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.

Follow, follow,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Rise up shepherd, and follow.

00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
you’ll forget your herds,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
