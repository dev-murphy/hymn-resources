00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Saviour, teach me day by day,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Love’s sweet lesson to obey,

Sweeter lesson cannot be,

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
With a child’s glad heart of love,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
At Thy bidding may I move,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Prompt to serve and follow Thee,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I am Thine, and Thine alone;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thine to keep, to rule, to save

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
From all sin that would enslave.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Love in loving finds employ,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Ever new that joy will be,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Learning how to love from Thee,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
