1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O worship the King, all glorious above,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
O gratefully sing His wonderful love;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Pavilioned in splendor, and girded with praise.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O tell of His might, O sing of His grace,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Whose robe is the light, whose canopy space,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thy bountiful care, what tongue can recite?

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thy mercies how tender, how firm to the end!

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend.
