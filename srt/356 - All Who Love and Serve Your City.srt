1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
All who love and serve your city,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All who bear its daily stress,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All who cry for peace and justice,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All who curse and all who bless.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In your day of loss and sorrow,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In your day of helpless strife,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Honor, peace, and love retreating,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Seek the Lord, who is your life.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
For all days are days of judgment,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And the Lord is waiting still,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Drawing near His friends who spurn Him,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Off’ring peace from Calv’ry’s hill.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Risen Lord, shall yet the city

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Be the city of despair?

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Come today, our judge, our glory;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Be its name “The Lord is there!”
