1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Look upon a little child;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Pity my simplicity,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Suffer me to come to Thee.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Lamb of God, I look to Thee;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thou shalt my example be;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thou art gentle, meek, and mild,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thou wast once a little child.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Fain I would be as Thou art;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Give me Thy obedient heart;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thou art pitiful and kind,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let me have Thy loving mind.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I shall then show forth Thy praise,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Serve Thee all my happy days;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then the world shall always see

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Christ, the Holy Child, in me.
