1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Father, lead me day by day,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Ever in Thine own sweet way;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Teach me to be pure and true;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Show me what I ought to do.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
When in danger, make me brave;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Make me know that Thou canst save;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Keep me safe by Thy dear side;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let me in Thy love abide.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
When tempted to do wrong,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Make me steadfast, wise, and strong;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And when all alone I stand,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Shield me with Thy mighty hand.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
May I do the good I know,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Be Thy loving child below,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then at last go home to Thee,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Evermore Thy child to be.
