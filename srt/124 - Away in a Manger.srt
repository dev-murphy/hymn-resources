1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The stars in the sky looked down where he lay,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The little Lord Jesus asleep in the hay.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And stay by my cradle til morning is nigh.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And take us to heaven, to live with Thee there.
