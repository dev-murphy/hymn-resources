1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Fairest Lord Jesus, ruler of all nature,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
O thou of God and man the Son!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
thou, my soul’s glory, joy, and crown.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
robed in the blooming garb of spring:

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
who makes the woeful heart to sing.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and all the twinkling starry host:

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
than all the angels heaven can boast.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Beautiful Savior! Lord of all the nations,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Son of God and Son of Man!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Glory and honor, praise, adoration,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
now and forevermore be thine!
