1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O God from whom mankind derives its name;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Whose covenant of grace remains the same,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Be with these two who now before You wait;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Enlarge the love they come to consecrate.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
May through their union other lives be blessed;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Their door be wide to stranger and to guest,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Give them the understanding that is kind,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Grant them the blessing of an open mind.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Preserve their days from inwardness of hear;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To each the gift of truthful speech impart.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Their bond be strong against all strain and strife

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Amid the changes of this earthly life.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
From stage to stage on life’s unfolding way

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Bring to their mind the vows they make this day,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Your Spirit be their Guide in every move,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Their faith in Christ the basis of their love.
