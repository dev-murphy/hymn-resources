1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
God in His love for us lent us this planet,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Gave it a purpose in time and in space:

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Small as a spark from the fire of creation,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Cradle of life and the home of our race.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thanks be to God for its bounty and beauty,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Life that sustains us in body and mind:

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Plenty for all, if we learn how to share it,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Riches undreamed of to fathom and find.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Long have our human wars ruined its harvest;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Long has earth bowed to the terror of forced;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Long have we wasted what others have need of,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Poisoned the fountain of life at its source.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Earth is the Lord’s: it is ours to enjoy it,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Ours, as His stewards, to farm and defend.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
From its pollution, misuse, and destruction,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Good Lord, deliver us, world without end!
