1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Rise up, O men of God!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
His kingdom tarries long.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Bring in the day of brotherhood

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and end the night of wrong.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let women all rise up!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Have done with lesser things.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Give heart and mind and soul and strength

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to serve the King of kings.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Rise up, courageous youth!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The church for you doth wait,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
her strength unequal to her task;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
rise up, and make her great!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Lift high the cross of Christ!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Tread where his feet have trod.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Disciples of the Son of Man,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
rise up, O church of God!
