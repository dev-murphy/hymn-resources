1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
For thee, O dear country,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Mine eyes their vigils keep;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For very love beholding

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thy holy name, they weep.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O one, O only mansion!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
O Paradise of joy!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Where tears are ever banish’d

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And smiles have no alloy;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
With jasper glow thy burwarks,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thy streets with emeralds blaze;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The sardius and the topaz

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Unite in thee their rays;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The cross is all thy splendor,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The Crucified thy praise;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
His laud and benediction

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thy ransom’d saints shall raise;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O sweet and blessed country,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The home of God’s elect!

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
O sweet and blessed country

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That eager hearts expect!
