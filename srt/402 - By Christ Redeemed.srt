1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
By Christ redeemed, In Christ restored,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We keep the memory adored,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And show the death of our dear Lord,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Until He come.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
His broken body in our stead is here,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In his memorial bread;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And so our feeble love is fed,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Until He come.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
His fearful drops of agony,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
His lifeblood shed for us we see;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The wine shall tell the mystery,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Until He come.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And thus that dark betrayal night,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
With the last advent we unite

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The shame, the glory, by this rite,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Until He come.
