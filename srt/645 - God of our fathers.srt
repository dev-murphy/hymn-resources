1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
God of our fathers, Whose almighty hand

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Leads forth in beauty all the starry band

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Of shining worlds in splendor through the skies

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Our grateful songs before Thy throne arise.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thy love divine hath led us in the past,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In this free land by Thee our lot is cast,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Be Thou our Ruler, Guardian, Guide and Stay,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thy Word our law, Thy paths our chosen way.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
From war’s alarms, from deadly pestilence,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Be Thy strong arm our ever sure defense;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thy true religion in our hearts increase,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thy bounteous goodness nourish us in peace.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Refresh Thy people on their toilsome way,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Lead us from night to never ending day;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Fill all our lives with love and grace divine,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And glory, laud, and praise be ever Thine.
