1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I need Thee precious Jesus, for I am very poor;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A stranger and a pilgrim, I have no earthly store.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I need the love of Jesus to cheer me on my way,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To guide my doubting foot steps, to be my strength and stay.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I need the heart of Jesus to feel each anxious care,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To tell my every trial, and all my sorrows share.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I need the Holy Spirit to teach me what I am,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To show me more of Jesus, to point me to the Lamb.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I need Thee precious Jesus, I hope to see Thee soon,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Encircled with the rainbow, and seated on Thy throne.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There with Thy blood-bought children, my joy shall ever be

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To sing Thy ceaseless praises, to gaze, my Lord, on Thee.
