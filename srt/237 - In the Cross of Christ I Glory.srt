1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the cross of Christ I glory,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
towering o’er the wrecks of time;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
all the light of sacred story

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
gathers round its head sublime.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
When the woes of life o’ertake me,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
hopes deceive, and fears annoy,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
never shall the cross forsake me.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Lo! it glows with peace and joy.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
When the sun of bliss is beaming

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
light and love upon my way,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
from the cross the radiance streaming

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
adds more luster to the day.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
by the cross are sanctified;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
peace is there that knows no measure,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
joys that through all time abide.
