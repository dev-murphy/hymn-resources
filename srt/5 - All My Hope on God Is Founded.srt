1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
All my hope on God is founded;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He doth still my trust renew.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Me through change and chance He guideth,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Only good and only true.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
God unknown, He alone

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Calls my heart to be His own.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Pride of man and earthly glory,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Sword and crown betray his trust;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What with care and toil he buildeth,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Tower and temple fall to dust.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But God’s power, hour by hour,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Is my temple and my tower.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
God’s great goodness aye endureth,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Deep His wisdom, passing thought;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Splendor, light and life attend Him,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Beauty springeth out of naught.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Love doth stand at His hand;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Joy doth wait on His command.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Still from man to God eternal,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Sacrifice of praise be done.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
High above all praises praising,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
For the gift of Christ His son.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Christ doth call one and all:

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Ye who follow shall not fall.
