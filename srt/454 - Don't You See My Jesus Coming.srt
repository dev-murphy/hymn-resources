1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Don’t you see my Jesus coming,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
See Him come in yonder cloud?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
With ten thousand angels round Him,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How they do my Jesus crowd!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I am bound for the kingdom,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Will you go to glory with me?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Hallelujah! O praise ye the Lord!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Don’t you see the saints ascending,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hear them shouting thro’ the air.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Jesus smiling, trumpets sounding,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Now His glory they shall share.
