1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O solemn thought and can it be

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The hour o judgment now is come

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Which soon must fix our destiny,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And seal the sinner’s fearful down?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, it is so; the judgment hour

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Is swiftly hastening to its close;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Then will the Judge, in mighty power,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Descend in vengeance on His foes.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He who came down to earth to die

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
An offering for the sins of men,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And then ascended upon on high,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And will e’er long return again,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Is standing now before the ark,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And mercy seat and cherubim,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To plead His blood for saints, and make

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The last remembrance of their sin.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The solemn moment is at hand

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
When we who have His name confessed,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Each in his lot must singly stand

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And pass the final, searching test.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Jesus! we hope in Thee alone;

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In mercy now upon us look,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Confess our names before the throne,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And blot our sins from out Thy book.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
O blessed Savior! may we feel

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The full importance of this hour.

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Inspire our hearts with holy zeal,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And aid us by Thy Spirit’s power,

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That we may in Thy strength be strong,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And brave the conflict valiantly;

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Then, on Mount Zion, join the song,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And swell the notes of victory.
