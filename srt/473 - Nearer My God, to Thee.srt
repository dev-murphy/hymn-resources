1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
E’en though it be a cross that raiseth me,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
still all my song shall be,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
nearer, my God, to thee;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
darkness be over me, my rest a stone;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
yet in my dreams I’d be

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
nearer, my God, to thee;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There let the way appear, steps unto heaven;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
all that thou sendest me, in mercy given;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
angels to beckon me

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
nearer, my God, to thee;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Then, with my waking thoughts bright with thy praise,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
out of my stony griefs Bethel I’ll raise;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
so by my woes to be

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
nearer, my God, to thee;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Or if, on joyful wing cleaving the sky,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
sun, moon, and stars forgot, upward I fly,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
still all my song shall be,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
nearer, my God, to thee;

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!
