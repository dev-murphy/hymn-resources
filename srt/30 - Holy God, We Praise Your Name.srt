1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Holy God, we praise Your name;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Lord of all, we bow before You!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All on earth Your scepter claim,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All in heaven above adore You;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Infinite Your vast domain.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Everlasting is Your reign.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Hark! the loud celestial hymn

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Angel choirs above are raising,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Cherubim and seraphim,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In unceasing chorus praising;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Fill the heavens with sweet accord:

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Holy, holy, holy, Lord.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Holy Father, Holy Son,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Holy Spirit, three we name You;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
While in essence only one,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Undivided God we claim You;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And adoring bend the knee,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
While we own the mystery.
