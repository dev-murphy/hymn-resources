1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
God is our Song, and every singer blest

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Who praising Him finds energy and rest.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All who praise God with unaffected joy

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Give back to us the widom we destroy,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Give back to us the widom we destroy.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
God is our Song, for Jesus comes to save;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
While praising Him we offer all we have.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
New songs we sing, in ventures new unite,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
When Jesus leads us upward into light,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When Jesus leads us upward into light.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is our Song no conflict ever drowns;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Who praises God our human wrath disowns.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Love knows what rich complexities of sound

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
God builds upon a simple common ground,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
God builds upon a simple common ground.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
God is our Silence when no songs are sung,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
When ecstasy or sorrow stills the tongue.

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Glorious the faith which silently obeys

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Until we find again the voice of praise,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Until we find again the voice of praise.
