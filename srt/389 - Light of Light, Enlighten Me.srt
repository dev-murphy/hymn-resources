1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Light of light, enlighten me,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now anew the day is dawning;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sun of grace, the shadows flee;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Brighten Thou my Sabbath morning;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
With Thy joyous sunshine blest,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Happy is my day of rest.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let me with my heart today,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Holy, holy, holy, singing,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Rapt awhile from earth away,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
All my soul to Thee up springing,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Have a foretaste inward given

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
How they worship Thee in heaven.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Hence all care, all vanity!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
For the day to God is holy;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Come, Thou glorious Majesty,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Deign to fill this temple lowly;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Nought today my soul shall move,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Simply resting in Thy love.
