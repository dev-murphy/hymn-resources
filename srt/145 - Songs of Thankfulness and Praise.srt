1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Songs of thankfulness and praise,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Jesus, Lord, to You we raise,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Manifested by the star

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To the sages from afar;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Branch of royal David’s stem

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In Your birth at Bethlehem;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Anthems be to You addressed,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
God in man made manifest.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Manifest at Jordan’s stream,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Prophet, Priest, and King supreme;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And at Cana, wedding guest,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In Your Godhead manifest;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Manifest in power divine,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Changing water into wine;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Anthems be to You addressed,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
God in man made manifest.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Manifest in making whole

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Palsied limbs and fainting soul;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Manifest in valiant fight,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Quelling all the devil’s might;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Manifest in gracious will,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Ever bringing good from ill;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Anthems be to You addressed,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
God in man made manifest.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Grant us grace to see You, Lord,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Mirrored in Your holy Word;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
May we imitate Your way,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And be pure, as pure as we may,

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That we like You may be

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
At Your great epiphany;

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let us praise You, ever blest,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
God in man made manifest.
