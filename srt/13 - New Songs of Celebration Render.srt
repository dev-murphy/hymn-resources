1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
New songs of celebration render

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To Him who has great wonders done.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Love sits enthroned in ageless splendor:

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Come, and adore the mighty One.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He has made known His great salvation

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Which all His friends with joy confess:

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He has revealed to every nation

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
His everlasting righteousness.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Joyfully, heartily resounding,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let every instrument and voice

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Peal out the praise of grace abounding

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Calling the whole world to rejoice.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Trumpets and organs, set in motion

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Such sounds as make the heavens ring;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All things that live in earth and ocean,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Make music for your mighty King.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Rivers and seas and torrents roaring,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Honor the Lord with wild acclaim;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Mountains and stones look up adoring,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And find a voice to praise His name.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Righteous, commanding, ever glorious,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Praises be His that never cease:

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Just is our God, whose truth victorious,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Establishes the world in peace.
