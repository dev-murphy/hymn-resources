1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now praise the hidden God of love

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In whom we all must live and move,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Who shepherds us, at every stage

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thro’ youth, maturity, and age.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Who challenged us, when were young

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To storm the citadels of wrong;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
In care for others taught us how

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
God’s true community must grow.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Who bids us never lose our zest,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Tho’ age is urging us to rest,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But proves to us that we have still

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
A work to do, a place to fill.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Then talk no more of wasted time,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But Godward look, and upward climb,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Content to sleep, when day is done,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And rise refreshed, and travel on.
