1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O day of rest and gladness,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
O day of joy and light,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
O balm of care and sadness,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Most beautiful, most bright,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
On thee the high and lowly

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Before th’ eternal throne

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sing, “Holy, holy, holy,”

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To the Eternal One.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thou art a port protected

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
From storms that round us rise;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
A garden intersected

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
With streams of paradise;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thou art a cooling fountain

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In life’s dry dreary sand;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
From Thee, like Pisgah’s mountain,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We view our promised land.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
A day of sweet reflection

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Thou art, a day of love,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
A day to raise affection

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
From earth to things above.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
New graces ever gaining

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
From this our day of rest,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We seek the rest remaining

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
To mansions of the blest.
