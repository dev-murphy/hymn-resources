1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
All the way my Savior leads me;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What have I to ask beside?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Can I doubt His tender mercy,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Who through life has been my guide?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Heavenly peace, divinest comfort,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Here by faith in Him to dwell;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For I know whate’er befall me,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Jesus doeth all things well;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
For I know whate’er befall me,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Jesus doeth all things well.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All the way my Savior leads me;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Cheers each winding path I tread;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Gives me grace for every trial,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Feeds me with the living bread;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Though my weary steps may falter,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And my soul athirst may be,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Gushing from the Rock before me,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Lo, a spring of joy I see;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Gushing from the Rock before me,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Lo, a spring of joy I see.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
All the way my Savior leads me;

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
O the fullness of His love!

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Perfect rest to me is promised

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
In my Father’s house above;

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
When I wake to life immortal,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Wing my flight to realms of day,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
This my song through endless ages,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Jesus led me all the way;

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
This my song through endless ages,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Jesus led me all the way.
