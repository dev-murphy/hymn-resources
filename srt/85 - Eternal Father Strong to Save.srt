1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Eternal Father, strong to save,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Whose arm doth bind the restless wave,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Who bidd’st the mighty ocean deep

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Its own appointed limits keep;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O hear us when we cry to Thee

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For those in peril on the sea.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O Saviour, whose almighty word

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The winds and waves submissive heard,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Who walkedst on the foaming deep,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And calm amid its rage didst sleep;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
O hear us when we cry to Thee

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
For those in peril on the sea.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O Sacred Spirit, who didst brood

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Upon the chaos dark and rude,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Who badd’st its angry tumult cease,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And gavest light and life and peace;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O hear us when we cry to Thee

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
For those in peril on the sea.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
O Trinity of love and power,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Our brethren shield in danger’s hour;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
From rock and tempest, fire and foe,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Protect them wheresoe’er they go;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And ever let there rise to Thee

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Glad hymns of praise from land and sea.
