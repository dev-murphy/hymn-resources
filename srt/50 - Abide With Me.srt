1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Earth’s joys grow dim; its glories pass away;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Change and decay in all around I see;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I need Thy presence every passing hour.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me!
