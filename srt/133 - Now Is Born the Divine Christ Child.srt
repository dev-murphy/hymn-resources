1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now is born the divine Christ child,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Play the musette, play the tuneful oboe,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now is born the divine Christ child,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sing we all and rejoice this day.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He was born in a stable bare,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
On bed of straw how He sleeps so soundly,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He was born in a stable bare,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let us worship and to Him bow.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Ages long since are past and gone,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When the wise men foretold His coming,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Ages long since are past and gone,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
When the wise men foretold His birth.
