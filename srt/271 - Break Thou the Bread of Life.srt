1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Break thou the bread of life, dear Lord, to me,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
as thou didst break the loaves beside the sea;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
beyond the sacred page I seek thee, Lord;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
my spirit pants for thee, O Living Word!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Bless thou the truth, dear Lord, to me, to me,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
as thou didst bless the bread by Galilee;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
then shall all bondage cease, all fetters fall;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and I shall find my peace, my all in all.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thou art the bread of life, O Lord, to me;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thy holy Word the truth That saveth me;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Give me to eat and live With Thee above;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Teach me to love Thy truth, For Thou art love.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Spirit and life are they, Words Thou dost speak;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I hasten to obey, But I am weak;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thou art my only help, Thou art my life;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Heeding Thy holy Word I win the strife.
