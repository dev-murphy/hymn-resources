1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O, for a faith that will not shrink,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Though pressed by many a foe,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That will not tremble on the brink of poverty,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Of poverty or woe; Of poverty or woe;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That will not murmur or complain

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Beneath the chastening rod,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But in the hour of grief or pain, of grief or pain

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Can lean upon its God; Can lean upon its God.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
A faith that shines more bright and clear

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When tempests rage without;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That when in danger knows no fear, knows of no fear,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In darkness feels no doubt; In darkness feels no doubt.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That bears unmoved the world’s dread frown,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Nor heeds its scornful smile;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That sin’s wild ocean cannot drown, no, cannot drown,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Nor its soft arts beguile; Nor its soft arts beguile.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Lord, give me such a faith as this,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And then, whate’er may come

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I’ll taste, e’en here the hallowed bliss, the hallowed bliss

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Of an eternal home; Of an eternal home.
