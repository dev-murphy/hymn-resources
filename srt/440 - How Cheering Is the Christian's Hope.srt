00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How cheering is the Christian’s hope,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
While toiling here below!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It bouys us up while this passing through

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This wilderness of woe,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It bouys us up while this passing through

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This wilderness of woe,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It bouys us up while passing through

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This wilderness of woe.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It points us to a land of rest,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Where saints with Christ will reign;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Where we shall meet the loved of earth,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And never part again.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Fly, lingering moments, fly, O, fly,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Dear Savior, quickly come!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We long to see Thee as Thou art,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And reach that blissful home.
