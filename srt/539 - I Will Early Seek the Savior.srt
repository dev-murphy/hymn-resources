1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I will early seek the Savior,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I will learn of Him each day;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I will follow in His footsteps,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I will walk the narrow way.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
For He loves me, yes, He loves me,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Jesus loves me, this I know.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Jesus loves me, died to save me,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is why I love Him so.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I will hasten where He bids me,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I am not too young to go

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
In the pathway where He leadeth,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Not too young His will to know.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He is standing at the doorway

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Of escape from every sin;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I will knock, for He has promised,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He will hear and let me in.
