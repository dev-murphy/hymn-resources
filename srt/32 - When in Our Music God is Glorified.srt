1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When in our music God is glorified,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And adoration leaves no room for pride,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is as though the whole creation cried:

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Alleluia!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
How oft, in making music, we have found

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A new dimension in the world of sound,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
As worship moved us to a more profound

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Alleluia!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And did not Jesus sing a psalm that night

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When utmost evil strove against the light?

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Then let us sing for whom He won the fight:

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Alleluia!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let every instrument be used for praise;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let all rejoice who have a voice to raise;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And may God give us faith to sing always:

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Alleluia!
