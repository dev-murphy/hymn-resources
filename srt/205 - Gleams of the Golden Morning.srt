1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The golden morning is fast approaching;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Jesus soon will come

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
To take his faithful and happy children

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
to their promised home

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O, we see the gleams of the golden morning

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
piercing thro’ this night of gloom!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O, see the gleams of the golden morning

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
that will burst the tomb.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The gospel summons will soon be carried

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
to the nations round;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The Bridegroom then will cease to tarry

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and the trumpet sound.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Attended by all the shining angels,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Down the flaming sky

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
the Judge will come, and will take his people

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
where they will not die.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The lov’d of earth who have long been parted,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Meet in that glad day;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The tears of those who are broken hearted

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
shall be wiped away.
