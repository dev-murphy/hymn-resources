And with joy His praises sing.

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Is required of every one;

Mirrors His redemptive plan.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
In compassion He has given

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Of His love that is divine;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
On the cross sins were forgiven;

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Joy and peace are fully thine.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Come in praise and adoration,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
All who in Christ’s name believe;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Worship Him with consecration,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000

For His grace give Him the glory,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
For the Spirit and the Word,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And repeat the gospel story

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Till mankind His name has heard.
