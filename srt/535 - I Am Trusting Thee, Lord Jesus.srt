1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Trusting only Thee;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Trusting Thee for full salvation,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Great and free.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I am trusting Thee for pardon;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
At Thy feet I bow;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For Thy grace and tender mercy,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Trusting now.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I am trusting Thee to guide me;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thou alone shalt lead;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Every day and hour supplying

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All my need.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Never let me fall;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I am trusting Thee forever,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And for all.
