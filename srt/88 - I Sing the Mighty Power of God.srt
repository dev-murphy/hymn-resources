1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I sing the mighty power of God,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That made the mountains rise,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That spread the flowing seas abroad,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And built the lofty skies.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I sing the wisdom that ordained

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The sun to rule the day;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The moon shines full at God’s command,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And all the stars obey.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I sing the goodness of the Lord,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who filled the earth with food,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Who formed the creatures thru the Word,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And then pronounced them good.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Lord, how thy wonders are displayed,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Where’er I turn my eye,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If I survey the ground I tread,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Or gaze upon the sky!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
There’s not a plant or flower below,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But makes Thy glories known,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And clouds arise, and tempests blow,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
By order from Thy throne;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Creatures that borrow life from thee

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Are subject to Thy care;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
There’s not a place where we can flee

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But God is present there.
