1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
‘Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Just to take Him at His word;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Just to rest upon his promise,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Just to know, “Thus saith the Lord.”

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How I’ve proved him o’er and o’er!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O for grace to trust him more!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O how sweet to trust in Jesus,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Just to trust his cleansing blood;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And in simple faith to plunge me

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Neath the healing, cleansing flood!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes, ’tis sweet to trust in Jesus,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Just from sin and self to cease;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Just from Jesus simply taking

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Life and rest, and joy and peace.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I’m so glad I learned to trust thee,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Precious Jesus, Savior, friend;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And I know that thou art with me,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Wilt be with me to the end.
