1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O Word of God incarnate,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
O Wisdom from on high,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
O Truth unchanged, unchanging,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
O Light of our dark sky:

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
we praise you for the radiance

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that from the hallowed page,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
a lantern to our footsteps,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
shines on from age to age.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The church from her dear Master

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
received the gift divine,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and still that light is lifted

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
o’er all the earth to shine.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It is the sacred vessel

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
where gems of truth are stored;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
it is the heaven-drawn picture

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
of Christ, the living Word.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It floateth like a banner

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
before God’s host unfurled;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
it is a shining beacon

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
above the darkling world.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It is the chart and compass

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
that o’er life’s surging tide,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
mid mists and rocks and quicksands,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Still guides, O Christ, to Thee.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
O make Thy church, dear Savior,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
a lamp of purest gold,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
to bear before the nations

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
your true light as of old.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
O teach your wandering pilgrims

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
by this their path to trace,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
till, clouds and darkness ended,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
they see Thee face to face.
