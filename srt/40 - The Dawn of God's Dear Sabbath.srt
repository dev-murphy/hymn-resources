1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The dawn of God’s dear Sabbath

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Breaks o’er the earth again,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
As some sweet summer morning

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
After a night of pain;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It comes as cooling showers

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To some exhausted land,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
As shade of clustered palm trees

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
‘Mid weary wastes of sand.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lord, we would bring for offering,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Though marred with earthly soil,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
A week of earnest labor,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Of steady, faithful toil,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Fair fruits of self denial,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Of strong, deep love to Thee,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Fostered by Thine own Spirit,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
In true humility.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And we would bring our burden

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Of sinful thought and deed,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
In Thy pure presence kneeling,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
From bondage to be freed,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Our heart’s most bitter sorrow

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
For all Thy work undone-

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So many talents wasted!

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So few bright laurels won!

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And with that sorrow mingling,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
A steadfast faith, and sure,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And love so deep and fervent,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
For Thee to make it pure,

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
In Thy dear presence finding

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The pardon that we need,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And then the peace so lasting-

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Celestial peace indeed.
