1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin?

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed?

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To do the will of Jesus: this is rest.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away?

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In Jesus’ keeping we are safe, and they.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown?

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.
