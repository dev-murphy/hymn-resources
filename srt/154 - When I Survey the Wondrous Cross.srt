1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When I survey the wondrous cross

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
on which the Prince of Glory died;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
my richest gain I count but loss,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and pour contempt on all my pride.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
save in the death of Christ, my God;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
all the vain things that charm me most,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I sacrifice them to his blood.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
See, from his head, his hands, his feet,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
sorrow and love flow mingled down.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
or thorns compose so rich a crown.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Were the whole realm of nature mine,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that were an offering far too small;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
love so amazing, so divine,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
demands my soul, my life, my all.
