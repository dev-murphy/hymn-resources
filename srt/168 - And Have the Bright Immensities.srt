1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And have the bright immensities

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Received our risen Lord,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Where light years frame the Pleiades

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And point Orion’s sword?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Do flaming suns His footsteps trace

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thro’corridors sublime,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The Lord of inter stellar space

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And conqueror of time?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The heav’n that hides Him from our sight

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Knows neither near nor far;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
A little candle sheds its light

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
As surely as a star.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And where His loving people meet

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To share the gift divine,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
There stands He with unhurrying feet;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
There heav’nly splendors shine.
