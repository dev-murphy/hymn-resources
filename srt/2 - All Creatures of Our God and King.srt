1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
All creatures of our God and King

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Lift up your voice and with us sing,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Alleluia! Alleluia!

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
O burning sun with golden beam

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And silver moon with softer gleam!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
O praise Him! O praise Him!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O rushing wind and breezes soft,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O clouds that ride the winds aloft,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
O praise Him! Alleluia!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
O rising morn, in praise rejoice,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
O lights of evening, find a voice!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O flowing waters, pure and clear,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Make music for your Lord to hear,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
O praise Him! Alleluia!

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
O fire so masterful and bright,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Providing us with warmth and light.

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let all things their Creator bless,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And worship Him in humbleness,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
O praise Him! Alleluia!

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh, praise the Father, praise the Son,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And praise the Spirit, three in One!
