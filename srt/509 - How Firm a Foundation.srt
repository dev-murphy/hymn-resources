1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is laid for your faith in his excellent word!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What more can he say than to you he hath said,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
to you who for refuge to Jesus have fled?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
“Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
for I am thy God and will still give thee aid;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I’ll strengthen and help thee, and cause thee to stand

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.”

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
“When through deep waters I call thee to go,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the rivers of woe shall not thee overflow;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
for I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.”

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
“When through fiery trials thy pathways shall lie,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
my grace, all-sufficient, shall be thy supply;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
the flame shall not hurt thee; I only design

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.”

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
“The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for respose,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I will not, I will not depart to His foes;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I’ll never, no never, no never forsake!”
