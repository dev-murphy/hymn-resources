1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Draw us in the Spirit’s tether,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For when humbly in Thy name,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Two or three are met together

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thou are in the midst of them;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Alleluia! Alleluia!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Touch we now Thy garment’s hem.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
As the brethren used to gather

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In the name of Christ to sup,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Then with thanks to God the Father

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Break the bread and bless the cup,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Alleluia! Alleluia!

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So knit Thou our friendship up.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All our meals and all our living

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Make as sacraments of Thee,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That by caring, helping, giving

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We may true disciples be.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Alleluia! Alleluia!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We will serve Thee faithfully.
