1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I hear Thy welcome voice,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That calls me, Lord, to Thee;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For cleansing in Thy precious blood,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That flowed on Calvary.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I am coming, Lord!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Coming now to Thee!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Wash me, cleanse me, in the blood

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That flowed on Calvary.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Though coming weak and vile,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thou dost my strength assure;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Till spotless all, and pure.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
‘Tis Jesus calls me on

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To perfect faith and love,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To perfect hope, and peace, and trust,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
For earth and heaven above.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
All hail, atoning blood!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
All hail, redeeming grace!

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
All hail! the gift of Christ, our Lord,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
