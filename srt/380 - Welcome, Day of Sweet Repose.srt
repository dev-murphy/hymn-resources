00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Welcome, day of sweet repose!

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Blessed be thy sacred hours!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We would trust the One who knows

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All our weak and failing powers.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Welcome, day in Eden born!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Holy rest for sinless man!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like the dawning of fair morn

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come thy hours to us again.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Welcome, day blessed by our Lord!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Toil shall cease and anxious care.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Day commanded by His word,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Day for song and praise and prayer.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Welcome, day our Savior kept!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Keeping, wrought our righteousness,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Day God bids us ne’er forget,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Day of days His name to bless.
