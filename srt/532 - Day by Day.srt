1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Day by day, and with each passing moment,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Strength I find, to meet my trials here;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Trusting in my Father’s wise bestowment,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I’ve no cause for worry or for fear.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He Whose heart is kind beyond all measure

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Gives unto each day what He deems best—

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Mingling toil with peace and rest.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Every day, the Lord Himself is near me

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
With a special mercy for each hour;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All my cares He fain would bear, and cheer me,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He Whose Name is Counselor and Power;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The protection of His child and treasure

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Is a charge that on Himself He laid;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
“As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,”

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This the pledge to me He made.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Help me then in every tribulation

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That I lose not faith’s sweet consolation

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Offered me within Thy holy Word.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Ever to take, as from a father’s hand,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Till I reach the promised land.
