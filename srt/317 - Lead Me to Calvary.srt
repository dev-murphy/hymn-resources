1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
King of my life, I crown Thee now,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thine shall the glory be;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Lest I forget Thy thorn crowned brow,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Lead me to Calvary.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Lest I forget Gethsemane,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Lest I forget Thine agony;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Lest I forget Thy love for me,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Lead me to Calvary.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Tenderly mourned and wept;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Angels in robes of light arrayed

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let me like Mary, through the gloom,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Come with a gift to Thee;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Show to me now the empty tomb,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Lead me to Calvary.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
May I be willing, Lord, to bear

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Daily my cross for Thee;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Even Thy cup of grief to share,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Thou hast borne all for me.
