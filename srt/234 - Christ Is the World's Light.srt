1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Christ is the world’s light,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Christ and none other;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
born in our darkness,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He became our brother-

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
if we have seen Him,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
we have seen the Father:

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Glory to God on high!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Christ is the world’s peace,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Christ and none other;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
no one can serve Him,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and despise another.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Who else unites us,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
one in God the Father?

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Glory to God on high!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Christ is the world’s life,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Christ and none other;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
sold once for silver,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
murdered here, our brother-

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He, who redeems us,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
reigns with God the Father:

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Glory to God on high!

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Give God the glory,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
God and none other;

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
give God the glory,

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Spirit, Son and Father;

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
give God the glory,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
God-with-us our brother:

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Glory to God on high!
