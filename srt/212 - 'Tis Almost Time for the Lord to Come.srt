1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
’Tis almost time for the Lord to come,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I hear the people say;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The stars of heaven are growing dim,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It must be the breaking of the day.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O it must be the breaking of the day!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
O it must be the breaking of the day!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The night is almost gone,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The day is coming on;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O it must be the breaking of the day!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The signs foretold in the sun and moon,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
In earth and sea and sky,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Aloud proclaim to all mankind,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The coming of the Master draweth nigh.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It must be time for the waiting church

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To cast her pride away,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
With girded loins and burning lamps,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
To look for the breaking of the day.

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Go quickly out in the streets and lanes

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And in the broad highway,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And call the maimed, the halt, and blind,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
To be ready for the breaking of the day.
