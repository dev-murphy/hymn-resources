1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It may not be on the mountain height

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Or over the stormy sea,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It may not be at the battle’s front

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
My Lord will have need of me.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But if, by a still, small voice he calls

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To paths that I do not know,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I’ll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in thine;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I’ll go where you want me to go.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I’ll go where you want me to go, dear Lord,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Over mountain or plain or sea;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I’ll say what you want me to say, dear Lord;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I’ll be what you want me to be.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Perhaps today there are loving words

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Which Jesus would have me speak

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
There may be now in the paths of sin

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Some wand’rer whom I should seek.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O Savior, if thou wilt be my guide,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Tho dark and rugged the way,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
My voice shall echo the message sweet;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I’ll say what you want me to say.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
There’s surely somewhere a lowly place

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In earth’s harvest fields so wide

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Where I may labor through life’s short day

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
For Jesus, the Crucified.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So trusting my all to thy tender care,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And knowing thou lovest me,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I’ll do thy will with a heart sincere:

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I’ll be what you want me to be.
