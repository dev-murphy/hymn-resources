1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The Lord in Zion reigneth, let all the world rejoice,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And come before His throne of grace with tuneful heart and voice;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The Lord in Zion reigneth, and there His praise shall ring,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To Him shall princes bend the knee and kings their glory bring.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The Lord in Zion reigneth, and who so great as He?

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The depths of earth are in His hands; He rules the mighty sea.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O crown His Name with honor, and let His standard wave,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Till distant isles beyond the deep shall own His power to save.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The Lord in Zion reigneth, these hours to Him belong;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
O enter now His temple gates, and fill His courts with song;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Beneath His royal banner let every creature fall,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Exalt the King of heaven and earth, and crown Him Lord of all.
