1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Immortal, invisible, God only wise,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Almighty, victorious, Thy great Name we praise.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thy justice, like mountains, high soaring above

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thy clouds, which are fountains of goodness and love.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
To all, life Thou givest, to both great and small;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In all life Thou livest, the true life of all;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And wither and perish – but naught changeth Thee.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Great Father of glory, pure Father of light,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All praise we would render; O help us to see

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
‘Tis only the splendor of light hideth Thee!
