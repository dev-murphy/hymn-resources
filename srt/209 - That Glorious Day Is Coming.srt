1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That glorious day is coming,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The hour is hastening on;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Its radiant light is nearing,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Far brighter than the sun;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In yonder clouds of heaven,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Saviour will appear,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And gather all His chosen,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To meet Him in the air.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The saints, then all victorious

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Will go to meet their Lord;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
An earth both bright and glorious,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Will then be their reward;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And God Himself there reigning,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Will wipe all tears away;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Nor clouds nor night remaining,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But one eternal day.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O Christian, keep from sleeping,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And let your love abound;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Be watchful, prayerful, faithful,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The trumpet soon will sound!

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
O sinner, hear the warning!

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
To Jesus quickly fly!

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Then you, in that blest morning,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
May meet Him in the sky!
