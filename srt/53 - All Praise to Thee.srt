1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
All praise to thee, my God, this night,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
for all the blessings of the light!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Keep me, O keep me, King of kings,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
beneath thine own almighty wings.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Forgive me, Lord, for thy dear Son,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the ill that I this day have done,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
that with the world, myself, and thee,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O may my soul on thee repose,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and with sweet sleep mine eyelids close,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
sleep that may me more vigorous make

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to serve my God when I awake.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
praise him, all creatures here below;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
praise him above, ye heavenly host;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
