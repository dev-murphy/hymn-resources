00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Thanks to God whose Word was spoken

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In the deed that made the earth.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
His the voice that called a nation;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
His the fires that tried her worth.

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
God has spoken;

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Praise Him For His open Word

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thanks to God whose Word incarnate

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Glorified the flesh of man.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Deeds and words and death and rising

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Tell the grace in heaven’s plan.

By the Spirit’s voice within.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Here we drink of joy unmeasured,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Life redeemed from death and sin.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
God has spoken;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
