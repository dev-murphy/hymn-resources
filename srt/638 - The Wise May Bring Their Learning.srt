1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
wise may bring their learning,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The rich may bring their wealth,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And some may bring their greatness,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And some their strength and health:

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We too would bring our treasures

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To offer to the King,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We have no wealth or learning—

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What shall we children bring?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We’ll bring Him hearts that love Him,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We’ll bring Him thankful praise,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And young souls meekly striving

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To follow in His ways:

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And these be the treasures

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We offer to the King,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And these are gifts that ever

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The poorest child may bring.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We’ll bring the little duties

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We have to do each day;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We’ll try our best to please Him

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
At home, at school, at play:

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And better are these treasures

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
To offer to the King

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Than richest gift without them:

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yet these a child may bring.
