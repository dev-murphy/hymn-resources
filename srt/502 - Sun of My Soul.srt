1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Sun of my soul, O Savior dear!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It is not night if Thou be near;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
O may no earth-born cloud arise

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To hide Thee from Thy servant’s eyes.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
When soft the dews of kindly sleep

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
My weary eyelids gently steep,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Be my last thought how sweet to rest

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Forever on my Savior’s breast!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Abide with me from morn till eve,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
For without Thee I cannot live;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Abide with me when night is nigh,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
For without Thee I dare not die.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Be near and bless me when I wake,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Ere through the world my way I take;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Till in the ocean of Thy love

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I lose myself in heaven above.
