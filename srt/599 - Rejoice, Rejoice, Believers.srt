1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Rejoice, rejoice, believers, and let your lights appear:

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The evening is advancing, and darker night is near.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The Bridegroom is arising, and soon He draweth nigh.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Up, pray, and watch, and wrestle, at midnight comes the cry.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The watchers on the mountain proclaim the Bride-groom near.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Go, meet Him as He cometh, with hallelujahs clear.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The marriage feast is waiting, the gates wide open stand;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Up, up, you heirs of glory, the Bride-groom is at hand.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You saints who here in patience your cross and suff’rings bore,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Shall live and reign forever, when sorrow is no more.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Upon the throne of glory the Lamb you shall behold,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In triumph cast before Him your diadems of gold!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Our hope and expectation, O Jesus, now appear;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Arise, O sun so longed for, o’er this benighted sphere!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
With hearts and hands uplifted, we plead, O Lord, to see

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The day of earth’s redemption that brings us unto Thee.
