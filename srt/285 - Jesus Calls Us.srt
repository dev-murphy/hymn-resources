1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus calls us o’er the tumult

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
of our life’s wild, restless sea;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
day by day his sweet voice soundeth,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
saying, “Christian, follow me!”

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Jesus calls us from the worship

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
of the vain world’s golden store,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
from each idol that would keep us,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
saying, “Christian, love me more!”

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
In our joys and in our sorrows,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
days of toil and hours of ease,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
still he calls, in cares and pleasures,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
“Christian, love me more than these!”

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Jesus calls us! By thy mercies,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Savior, may we hear thy call,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
give our hearts to thine obedience,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
serve and love thee best of all.
