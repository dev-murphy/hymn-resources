1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Will your anchor hold in the storms of life,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When the clouds unfold their wings of strife?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Will your anchor drift or firm remain?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We have an anchor that keeps the soul

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Grounded firm and deep in the Savior’s love.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It is safely moored, ’twill the storm withstand,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
For ’tis well secured by the Savior’s hand;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And the cables passed from His heart to mine,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Can defy the blast, through strength divine.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It will firmly hold in the straits of fear,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
When the breakers have told the reef is near;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Though the tempest rave and the wild winds blow,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Not an angry wave shall our bark o’erflow.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It will surely hold in the floods of death,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
When the waters cold chill our latest breath;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
On the rising tide it can never fail,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
While our hopes abide within the veil.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
When our eyes behold, in the dawning light,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Shining gates of pearl, our harbor bright,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We shall anchor fast to the heavenly shore,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
With the storms all past forevermore.
