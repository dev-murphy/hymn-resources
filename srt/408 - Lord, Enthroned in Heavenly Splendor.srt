1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord, enthroned in heav’nly splendor,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
First begotten from the dead,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You alone, our strong defender,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Lifting up Your people’s head.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Alleluia, Jesus, true and living Bread!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Tho’ the lowliest form now veil You

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
As of old in Bethlehem,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Here as there Your angels hail You

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Branch and flow’r of Jesse’s stem.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Alleluia, We in worship join with them.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Paschal Lamb, Your off’ring finished

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Once for all when You were slain,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In its fullness undiminished

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Shall forever more remain.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Alleluia, Cleansing souls from every stain.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Life imparting heav’nly manna,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Stricken rock with streaming side,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Heav’n and earth with loud hosanna

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Worship You the Lamb who died.

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Alleluia, Ris’n, ascended, glorified!
