1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings, thy better portion trace;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Rise from transitory things toward heaven, thy native place;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sun, and moon, and stars decay; time shall soon this earth remove;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Rise, my soul, and haste away to seats prepared above.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Rivers to the ocean run, nor stay in all their course;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Fire ascending seeks the sun; both speed them to their source;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So a soul that’s born of God, longs to view His glorious face,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Forward tends to His abode to rest in His embrace.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn; press onward to the prize;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Soon our Savior will return, triumphant in the skies;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yet a season, and you know happy entrance will be given,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All our sorrows left below, and earth exhcanged for heaven.
