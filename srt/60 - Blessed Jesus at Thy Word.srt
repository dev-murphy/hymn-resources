00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Blessed Jesus, at Thy word,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We have gathered all to hear Thee;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
By Thy word our hearts were stirred,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now to seek and love and fear Thee.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
By Thy teachings sweet and holy,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let us learn to love Thee solely.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
All our knowledge, sense, and sight,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Lie in deepest darkness shrouded;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Till Thy Spirit breaks our night,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
With His beams of truth unclouded.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He alone to God canst win us,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He who works all good within us.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Glorious Lord, Thy self impart!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Light of light, from God proceeding.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Open Thou our ears and heart

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Help us, by Thy Spirit’s pleading.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hear the cry Thy people raises!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hear, and bless our prayer and praises!
