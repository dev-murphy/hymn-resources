1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Anywhere He leads me in this world below;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Anywhere, anywhere! Fear I cannot know;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Though His hand may lead me over drearest ways,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
When the darkening shadows round about me creep,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.
