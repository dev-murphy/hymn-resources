1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
God’s free mercy streameth over all the world,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And His banner gleameth, By His church unfuried;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Broad and deep and glorious, As the heaven above,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Shines in might victorious His eternal love.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Summer suns are glowing over land and sea;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Happy light is flowing, Bountiful and free;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Everything rejoices in the mellow rays;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Earth’s ten thousand voices swell the psalm of praise.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lord, upon our blindness thy pure radiance pour;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
For Thy loving kindness we would love Thee more;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And when clouds are drifting dark across the sky,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Then, the veil uplifting, father, be Thou nigh.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We will never doubt Thee, tho’ veil Thy light;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Life is dark without Thee, death with Thee is bright.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Light of light, shine o’er us on our pilgrim way,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Go Thou still before us to the endless day.
