1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus, lover of my soul, let me to Thy bosom fly,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
While the nearer waters roll, while the tempest still is high.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hide me, O my Savior, hide, till the storm of life is past;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Safe into the haven guide; O receive my soul at last.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Other refuge have I none, hangs my helpless soul on Thee;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Leave, ah! leave me not alone, still support and comfort me.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
All my trust on Thee is stayed, all my help from Thee I bring;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Cover my defenseless head with the shadow of Thy wing.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thou, O Christ, art all I want, more than all in Thee I find;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint, heal the sick, and lead the blind.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Just and holy is Thy Name, I am all unrighteousness;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
False and full of sin I am; Thou art full of truth and grace.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Plenteous grace with Thee is found, grace to cover all my sin;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the healing streams abound; make and keep me pure within.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thou of life the fountain art, freely let me take of Thee;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Spring Thou up within my heart; rise to all eternity.
