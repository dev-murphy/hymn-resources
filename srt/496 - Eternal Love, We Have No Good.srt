1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Eternal Love, we have no good to bring Thee,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No single good of all our hands have wrought,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
No worthy music have we found to sing Thee,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No jewelled word, no quick up soaring thought.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And yet we come; and when our faith would falter

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Show us, O Love, the quiet place of prayer,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The golden censer and the golden altar,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And the great angel waiting for us there.
