1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Heir of the kingdom, O why dost thou slumber?

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Why art thou sleeping so near thy blest home?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Wake thee, arouse thee, and gird on thine armor,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Speed, for the moments are hurrying on.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Heir of the kingdom, say, why dost thou linger?

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How canst thou tarry in sight of the prize?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Up, and adorn thee, the Savior is coming;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Haste to receive Him descending the skies.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Earth’s mighty nations, in strife and commotion,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Tremble with terror, and sink in dismay;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Listen, ’tis nought but the chariot’s loud rumbling;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Heir of the kingdom, no longer delay.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Stay not, O stay not for earth’s vain allurements!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
See how its glory is passing away;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Break the strong fetters the foe hath bound o’er thee;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Heir of the kingdom, turn, turn thee away.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Keep the eye single, the head upward lifted;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Watch for the glory of earth’s coming King;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Lo! o’er the mountaintops light is now breaking;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Heirs of the kingdom, rejoice ye and sing.
