1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Take time to be holy,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
speak oft with thy Lord;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
abide in him always,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and feed on his word.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Make friends of God’s children,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
help those who are weak,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
forgetting in nothing

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
his blessing to seek.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Take time to be holy,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the world rushes on;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
spend much time in secret

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
with Jesus alone.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
By looking to Jesus,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
like him thou shalt be;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
thy friends in thy conduct

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
his likeness shall see.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Take time to be holy,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
let him be thy guide,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and run not before him,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
whatever betide.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
In joy or in sorrow,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
still follow the Lord,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and, looking to Jesus,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
still trust in his word.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Take time to be holy,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
be calm in thy soul,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
each thought and each motive

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
beneath his control.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Thus led by his spirit

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
to fountains of love,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
thou soon shalt be fitted

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
for service above.
