1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Son of God, eternal Savior,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Source of life and truth and grace,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Work made flesh, whose birth among us

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hallows all our human race,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You our head, who throned in glory,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For Your own will ever plead:

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Fill us with Your love and pity,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Heal our wrongs, and help our need.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Bind us all as one together

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In Your church’s sacred fold,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Weak and healthy, poor and wealthy,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Sad and joyful, young and old.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Is there want or pain or sorrow?

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Make us all the burden share.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Are there spirits crushed and broken?

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Teach us, Lord, to soothe their care.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
As You, Lord, have lived for others,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So may we for others live.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Freely have Your gifts been granted;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Freely may Your servants give.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yours the gold and Yours the silver,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yours the wealth of land and sea;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We but stewards of Your bounty

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Held in solemn trust will be.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Come, O Christ, and reign among us,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
King of love and Prince of Peace;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Hush the storm of strife and passion,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Bid its cruel discords cease.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
By Your patient years of toiling,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
By Your silent hours of pain,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Quench our fevered thirst of pleasure,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Stem our selfish greed of gain.

33
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Son of God, eternal Savior,

34
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Source of life and truth and grace,

35
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Word made flesh, whose birth among us

36
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Hallows all our human race:

37
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:15,000
By Your praying, by Your willing

38
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That Your people should be one,

39
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Grant, oh, grant our hope’s fruition:

40
00:09:45,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Here on earth Your will be done.
