1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There’s a sweet, sweet spirit in this place,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And I know that it’s the spirit of the Lord;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sweet Holy Spirit,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sweet Heavenly Dove,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Stay right here with us,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Filling us with Your love,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And for these blessings

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We lift our hearts in praise,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Without a doubt we’ll know

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That we have been revived

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
When we shall leave this place.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
There are sweet expressions on each face,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And I know they feel the presence of the Lord.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Sweet Holy Spirit,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Sweet Heavenly Dove,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Stay right here with us,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Filling us with Your love,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And for these blessings

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We lift our hearts in praise,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Without a doubt we’ll know

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That we have been revived

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
When we shall leave this place.
