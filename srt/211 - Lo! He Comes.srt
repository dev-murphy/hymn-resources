1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lo! He comes, with clouds descending,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Once for favored sinners slain;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Countless angels, Him attending,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Swell the triumph of His train:

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Jesus comes, and comes to reign.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Every eye shall now behold Him

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Robed in dreadful majesty!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Those who set at nought and sold Him,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Pierced, and nailed Him to the tree,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Deeply wailing, Deeply wailing,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Shall the true Mesiah see!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
When the solemn trump has sounded,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Heaven and earth shall flee away;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All who hate Him, must, confounded,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Hear the summons of that day-

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
“Come to judgment! Come to judgment!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Come to judgment! Come away!”

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yea, amen! let all adore Thee,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
High on Thy eternal throne!

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Savior, take the power and glory,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Make Thy righteous sentence known;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
O come quickly, O come quickly,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Claim the kingdom for Thine own!
