1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come, ye thankful people, come,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Raise the song of harvest home;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All is safely gathered in,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Ere the winter storms begin.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
God our Maker doth provide

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For our wants to be supplied;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Come to God’s own temple, come;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Raise the song of harvest home!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We ourselves are God’s own field,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Fruit unto His praise to yield;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Wheat and tares together sown,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Unto joy or sorrow grown;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
First the blade and then the ear,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Then the full corn shall appear;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Grant, O harvest Lord, that we

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Wholesome grain and pure may be.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
For the Lord our God shall come,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And shall take His harvest home;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
From His field shall purge away

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All that doth offend, that day;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Give His angels charge at last

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In the fire the tares to cast;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But the fruitful ears to store

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
In His garner evermore.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Then, thou church triumphant, come,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Raise the song of harvest home;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
All are safely gathered in,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Free from sorrow, free from sin,

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
There, forever purified,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
In God’s garner to abide;

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Come, ten thousand angels, come,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Raise the glorious harvest home!
