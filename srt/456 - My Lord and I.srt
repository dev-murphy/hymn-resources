1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I have a Friend so precious,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So very dear to me,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He loves me with such tender love,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He loves so faithfully;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I could not live apart form Him,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I love to feel Him nigh,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And so we dwell together,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
My Lord and I.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sometimes I’m faint and weary,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He knows that I am weak,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And as He bids me lean on Him,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
His help I gladly seek;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He leads me in the paths of light,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Beneath a sunny sky,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And so we walk together,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
My Lord and I.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I tell Him all my sorrows,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I tell Him all my joys,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I tell Him all that pleases me,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I tell Him what annoys;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He tells me what I ought to do,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He tells me how to try,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And so we talk together,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
My Lord and I.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He knows that I am longing

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Some weary soul to win,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And so He bids me go and speak

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The loving word for Him;

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He bids me tell His wondrous love,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And why He came to die,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And so we work together,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
My Lord and I.
