00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I think when I read that sweet story of old,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When Jesus was here among men,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
How He called little children as lambs to His fold,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I should like to have been with Him then.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I wish that His hands had been placed on my head,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That His arm had been thrown around me,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And that I might have seen His kind look when He said,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
“Let the little ones come unto Me.”

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I long for the joy of that glorious time,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The sweetest and brightest and best,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
When the dear little children of every clime

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Shall crowd to His arms and be blest.
