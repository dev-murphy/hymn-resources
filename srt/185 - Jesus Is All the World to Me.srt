1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus is all the world to me,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
my life, my joy, my all;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
he is my strength from day to day,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
without him I would fall.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
When I am sad, to him I go,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
no other one can cheer me so;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
when I am sad, he makes me glad,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
he’s my friend.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Jesus is all the world to me,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
my friend in trials sore;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I go to him for blessings, and

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
he gives them o’er and o’er.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He sends the sunshine and the rain,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
he sends the harvest’s golden grain;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
sunshine and rain, harvest of grain,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
he’s my friend.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Jesus is all the world to me,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and true to him I’ll be;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
O how could I this friend deny,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
when he’s so true to me?

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Following him I know I’m right,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
he watches o’er me day and night;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
following him by day and night,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
he’s my friend.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Jesus is all the world to me,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I want no better friend;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I trust him now, I’ll trust him when

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
life’s fleeting days shall end.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Beautiful life with such a friend,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
beautiful life that has no end;

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
eternal life, eternal joy,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
he’s my friend.
