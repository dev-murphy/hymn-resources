1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Arise, my soul, arise!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Stretch forth to things eternal

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And hasten to the feet of your Redeemer God.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Though hid from mortal eyes,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He dwells in light supernal;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yet worship Him in humbleness and call Him Lord.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Awaits you above;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yet here He grants a foretaste of the feast

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
to come!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Rejoice, my soul, rejoice,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
To heav地 lift up your voice:

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Now hear the harps of heav地!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, hear the song victorious,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The never-ending anthem sounding

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
through the sky!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
To mortals is not giv地

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
To join in strains so glorious;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
our praises high!

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He bought with His blood

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The ransomed of God;

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
To Him be everlasting pow池 and victory.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And let the great amen

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Resound through heav地 again.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
