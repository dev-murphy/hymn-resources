1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I love Thee, I love Thee, I love Thee,my Lord;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I love Thee, my Savior, I love Thee, my God.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I love Thee, I love Thee, and that Thou dost know;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But how much I love Thee my actions will show.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I’m happy, I’m happy, O, wondrous account!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
My joys are immortal, I stand on the mount!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I gaze on my treasure and long to be there,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
With Jesus and angels, and kindred so dear.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O Jesus, my Savior, with Thee I am blest,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My life and salvation, my joy and my rest:

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thy name be my theme, and Thy love be my song;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thy grace shall inspire both my heart and my tongue.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O, who’s like my Savior? He’s Salem’s bright King;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He smiles, and He loves me, and helps me to sing.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I’ll praise Him, I’ll praise Him, with notes loud and clear

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
While rivers of pleasure my spirit do cheer.
