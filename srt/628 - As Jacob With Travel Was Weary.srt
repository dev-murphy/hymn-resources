1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
As Jacob with travel was weary one day,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
At night on a stone for a pillow he lay;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He saw in a vision a ladder so high

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That its foot was on earth and its top in the sky.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Alleluia to Jesus who died on the tree,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come let us ascend! All may climb it who will;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
For the angels of Jacob are guarding it still:

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And remember each step that by faith we passo’er,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Some prophet or martyr has trod it before.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And when we arrive at the haven of rest

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We shall hear the glad words, “Come up hither, ye blest,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Here are regions of light, here are mansions of bliss.”

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
O who would not climb such a ladder as this?
