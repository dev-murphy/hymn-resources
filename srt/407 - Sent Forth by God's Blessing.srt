1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Sent forth by God’s blessing,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Our true faith confessing,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The people of God from His dwelling take leave.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The supper is ended.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh, now be extended

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fruits of this service in all who believe.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The seed of His teaching,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Receptive souls reaching,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Shall blossom in action for God and for all.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
His grace did invite us,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
His love shall unite us

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To work for God’s kingdom and answer His call.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
With praise and thanksgiving

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To God ever living,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The tasks of our everyday life we will face.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Our faith ever sharing,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In love ever caring,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Embracing His children of each tribe and race.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
With Your feast You feed us,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
With Your light now lead us;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Unite us as one in this life that we share.

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Then may all the living

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
With praise and thanks giving

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Give honor to Christ and His name that we bear.
