1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
God has spoken by His prophets,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Spoken His unchanging Word,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Each from age to age proclaiming

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
God, the one, the righteous Lord.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Mid the world’s despair and turmoil,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
One firm anchor holding fast;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
God is King, His throne eternal,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
God the first, and God the last.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
God has spoken by Christ Jesus,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Christ, the everlasting Son,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Brightness of the Father’s glory,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
With the Father ever one;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Spoken by the Word incarnate,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
God of God, ere time began,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Light of light, to earth descending,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Man, revealing God to man.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
God yet speaks by His own Spirit

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Speaking to the hearts of men,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
In the age-long Word expounding

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
God’s own message, now as then;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Through the rise and fall of nations

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
One sure faith yet standing fast,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
God is King, His Word unchanging,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
God the first, and God the last.
