1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Ye servants of the Lord,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Each in his office wait,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Observant of His heavenly Word,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And watchful at His gate.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let all your lamps be bright,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And trim the golden flame,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Gird up your loins as in His sight,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
His coming thus proclaim.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Watch, ’tis your Lord’s command,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And while we speak He’s near;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Mark the first signal of His hand,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And ready all appear.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O happy servant, he,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In such a posture found!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He shall His Lord with rapture see,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And be with honor crowned.
