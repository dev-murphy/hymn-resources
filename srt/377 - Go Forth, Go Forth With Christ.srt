1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Go forth, go forth with Christ,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Who called you to this day,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He who has led, will lead

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And keep you in His way:

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
His word is fast, His promise sure

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To all who serve Him and endure.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Go forth, go forth with Christ,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
With purpose not your own,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Each vict’ry you shall gain

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Through Him your Lord alone:

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
To guard you in fidelity

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
His Spirit shall your strength’ner be.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Go forth, go forth with Christ,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
His Priesthood you shall share,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Who bought us by His blood

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
To be His servants here:

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Walk in the way your Savior trod,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Go forth with Him, go forth with God.
