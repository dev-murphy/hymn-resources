1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When He cometh, when He cometh

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To make up His jewels,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All His jewels, precious jewels,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
His loved and His own.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Like the stars of the morning,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
His brightness adorning,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They shall shine in their beauty,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Bright gems for His crown.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He will gather, He will gather

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The gems for His kingdom;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All the pure ones, all the bright ones,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
His loved and His own.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Little children, little children,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Who love their Redeemer,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Are the jewels, precious jewels,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
His loved and His own.
