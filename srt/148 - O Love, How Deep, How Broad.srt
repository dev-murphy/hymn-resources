1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O love, how deep, how broad, how high,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Beyond all thought and fantasy,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That God, the Son of God, should take

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Our mortal form for mortal’s sake!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
For us baptized, for us He bore

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
His holy fast and hungered sore;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For us temptation sharp He knew;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
For us the tempter overthrew.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
For us by wickedness betrayed,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
For us, in crown of thorns arrayed,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He bore the shameful cross and death;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
For us He gave His dying breath.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
For us He rose from death again,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
For us He went on high to reign;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
For us He sent His Spirit here

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
To guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
All glory to our Lord and God

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
For love so deep, so high, so broad;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The Trinity whom we adore

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Forevermore and forevermore.
