1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My faith looks up to thee,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
thou Lamb of Calvary,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Savior divine;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now hear me while I pray,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
take all my guilt away,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
O let me from this day

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
be wholly Thine.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
May thy rich grace impart

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
strength to my fainting heart,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
my zeal inspire!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
As thou hast died for me,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
O may my love to thee

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
pure, warm, and changeless be,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
a living fire!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
While life’s dark maze I tread,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and griefs around me spread,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
be thou my guide;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
bid darkness turn to day,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
wipe sorrow’s tears away,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
nor let me ever stray

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
from Thee aside.
