1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Ye watchers and ye holy ones,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Bright seraphs, cherubim and thrones,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Raise the glad strain, Alleluia!

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Cry out, dominions, princedoms, powers,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Virtues, archangels, angels’ choirs:

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Alleluia! Alleluia!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Alleluia! Alleluia!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Alleluia!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O higher than the cherubim,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
More glorious than the seraphim,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Lead their praises, Alleluia!

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thou bearer of th’eternal Word,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Most gracious, magnify the Lord.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
O friends, in gladness let us sing,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Supernal anthems echoing,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Alleluia! Alleluia!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
To God the Father, God the Son,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And God the Spirit, Three in One.
