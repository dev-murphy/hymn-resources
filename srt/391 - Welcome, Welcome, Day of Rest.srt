1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
To the world in kindness given;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Welcome to this humble breast,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
As the beaming light from heaven.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Day of calm and sweet repose,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Gently now thy moments run;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Balm to soothe our cares and woes,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Till our labor here is done.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Holy day that most we prize,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Day of solemn praise and prayer,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Day to make the simple wise,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
O, how great thy blessings are!

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Welcome, welcome, day of rest,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
With thy influence all divine;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
May thy hallowed hours be blessed

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
to this waiting heart of mine.
