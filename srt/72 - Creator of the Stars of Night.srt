1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Creator of the stars of night,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thy people’s everlasting light,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
O Christ, Thou Saviour of us all,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We pray Thee, hear us when we call.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
At the great name of Jesus, now

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
All knees must bend, all hearts must bow;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And things celestial Thee shall own,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And things terrestrial, Lord alone.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
To God the Father, God the Son,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And God the Spirit, Three in One,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Laud, honour, might, and glory be

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
From age to age eternally.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Amen.
