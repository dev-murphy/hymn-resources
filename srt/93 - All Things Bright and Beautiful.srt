1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
All things bright and beautiful

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All creatures great and small

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All things wise and wonderful

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Lord God made them all.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Each little flow’r that opens

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Each little bird that sings

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He made their glowing colours

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He made their tiny wings.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The purple-headed mountain

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The river running by

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The sunset and the morning

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That brighten up the sky.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The cold wind in the winter

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The pleasant summer sun

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The ripe fruits in the garden

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He made them, every one.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He gave us eyes to see them

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And lips that we might tell

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
How great is God Almighty

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Who has made all things well.
