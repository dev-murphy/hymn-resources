1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I want Thee forever to live in my soul;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Break down every idol, cast out every foe;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And help me to make a complete sacrifice;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I give up myself, and whatever I know;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
By faith, for my cleansing; I see Thy blood flow;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Come now, and within me a new heart create;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
To those who have sought Thee,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Thou never said’st No;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
