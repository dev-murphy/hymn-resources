1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Behold the King of glory waits;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The King of kings is drawing near,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Savior of the world is here.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The Lord is just, a helper tried;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Mercy is ever at His side;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
His kingly crowns is holiness,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
His scepter, pity in distress.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O blest the land, the city blest,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Where Christ the Ruler is confessed!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
O happy hearts and happy homes

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To whom this King in triumph comes!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Fling wide the portals of your heart;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Make it a temple, set apart

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
From earthly use for heaven’s employ,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Adorned with prayer, and love, and joy.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Redeemer, come; I open wide

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
My heart to Thee; here, Lord, abide.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let me Thy inner presence feel,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Thy grace and love in me reveal.
