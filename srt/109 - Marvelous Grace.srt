1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Marvelous grace of our loving Lord.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yonder on Calvary’s mount outpoured

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Grace, grace, God’s grace,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Grace, grace, God’s grace,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Grace that is greater than all our sin!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sin and despair, like the sea waves cold,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Threaten the soul with infinite loss;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Points to the Refuge, the mighty Cross.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Freely bestowed on all who believe!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You that are longing to see His face,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Will you this moment His grace receive?
