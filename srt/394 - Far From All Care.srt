1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Far from all care we hail the Sabbath morning;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
O’er waving fields and from the distant sea

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Swell notes of praise in harmony resounding

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
As all creation turns her heart to Thee.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Though man alone, Lord, of Thy great creation

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Fails now to laud Thee for Thy love and power,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yet still a remnant love Thee and remember

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thy holy law and each sweet Sabbath hour.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lord of the Sabbath, Savior and Creator,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Calm now the throbbings of each troubled breast.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Speak to our hearts the peace of Thy commandments,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Breathe on each soul fair Eden’s hallowed rest.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Strong in Thy might and quiet in Thy meekness,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
May we Thine image bear from day to day.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then may we enter pearly gates eternal

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And sing redemption’s song each Sabbath day.
