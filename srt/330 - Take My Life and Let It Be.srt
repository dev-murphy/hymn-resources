1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Take my life, and let it be

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Take my hands, and let them move

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
At the impulse of Thy love;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
At the impulse of Thy love.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Take my feet, and let them be

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Swift and beautiful for Thee.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Take my voice, and let me sing

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Always, only, for my King;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Always, only, for my King.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Take my lips, and let them be

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Filled with messages from Thee.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Take my silver and my gold:

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Not a mite would I withhold;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Not a mite would I withhold.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Take my will, and make it Thine,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It shall be no longer mine;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Take my heart, it is Thine own,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It shall be Thy royal throne.

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It shall be Thy royal throne.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Take my love, my Lord, I pour

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
At Thy feet its treasure store;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Take myself, and I will be,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Ever, only, all for Thee.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Ever, only, all for Thee.
