1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Heavenly Father, bless us now;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
At the cross of Christ we bow;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Take our guilt and grief away;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hear and heal us now, we pray.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now, O Lord, this very hour,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Send Thy grace and show Thy power;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
While we rest upon Thy word,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come, and bless us now, O Lord!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Mercy now, O Lord, we plead

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In this hour of utter need;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Turn us not away unblest;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Calm our anguish into rest.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O Thou loving, blessed One,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Rising oér us like the sun,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Light and life art Thou within:

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Savior, Thou, from every sin!
