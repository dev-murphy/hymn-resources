1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Be not dismayed whate’er betide,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
God will take care of you;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
beneath his wings of love abide,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
God will take care of you.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
God will take care of you,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
through every day, o’er all the way;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
he will take care of you,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
God will take care of you.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Through days of toil when heart doth fail,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
God will take care of you;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
when dangers fierce your path assail,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
God will take care of you.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All you may need he will provide,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
God will take care of you;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
nothing you ask will be denied,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
God will take care of you.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No matter what may be the test,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
God will take care of you;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
lean, weary one, upon his breast,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
God will take care of you.
