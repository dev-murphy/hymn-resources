1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There is beauty all around, When there’s love at home;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There is joy in every sound, When there’s love at home.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Peace and plenty here abide, Smiling fair on every side;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Time doth softly, sweetly glide, When there’s love at home.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Love at home, love at home;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Time doth softly, sweetly glide,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When there’s love at home.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Kindly heaven smiles above, When there’s love at home;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
All the earth is fill’d with love, When there’s love at home.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Sweeter sings the brooklet by, Brighter beams the azure sky;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
O, there’s One who smiles on high When there’s love at home.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Jesus, make me wholly Thine, Then there’s love at home;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
May Thy sacrifice be mine, Then there’s love at home.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Safely from all harm I’ll rest, With no sinful care distress’d,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thro’ Thy tender mercy blessed, When there’s love at home.
