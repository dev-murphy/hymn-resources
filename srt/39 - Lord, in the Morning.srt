1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
My voice ascending high;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
To Thee will I direct my prayer,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To Thee lift up mine eye-

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Up to the hills where Christ is gone

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To plead for all His saints,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Presenting at His Father’s throne

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Our songs and our complaints.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O may Thy Spirit guide my feet

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In ways of righteousness;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Make every path of duty straight

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And plain before my face.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Shall see their hopes fulfilled;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The mighty God will compass them

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
With favor as a shield.
