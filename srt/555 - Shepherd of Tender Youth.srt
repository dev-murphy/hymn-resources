1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Shepherd of tender you,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Guiding in love and truth,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Through devious way;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Christ our triumphant King,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We come Thy name to sin,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hither our children bring

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
To shout Thy praise.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thou are our holy Lord,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thee all subduing Word,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Healer of strife;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thou didst Thyself abase,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That from sin’s deep disgrace

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thou mightest save our race,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And give us life.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thou are the great High Priest;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thou has prepared the feast

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Of heavenly love;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
While in our mortal pain

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
None call on Thee in vain;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Help Thou does not disdain,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Help from above.

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Ever be Thou our Guide,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Our Shepherd and our pride,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Our staff and song;

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Jesus, Thou Christ of God,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
By Thy perennial word,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Lead us where Thou hast trod,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Make our faith strong.
