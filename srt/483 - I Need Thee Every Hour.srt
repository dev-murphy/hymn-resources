1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I need thee every hour, most gracious Lord;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
no tender voice like thine can peace afford.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I need thee, O I need thee;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
every hour I need thee;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O bless me now, my Savior, I come to thee.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I need thee every hour; stay thou nearby;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
temptations lose their power when thou art nigh.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I need thee every hour, in joy or pain;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
come quickly and abide, or life is vain.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I need thee every hour; teach me thy will;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and thy rich promises in me fulfill.
