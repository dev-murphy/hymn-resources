1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Christ upon the mountain peak

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Stands alone in glory blazing;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let us, if we dare to speak,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
With the saints and angels praise Him:

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Refrain:

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Trembling at His feet we saw

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Moses and Elijah speaking;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
All the prophets and the law

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Shout thro’ them their joyful greeting:

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Refrain:

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Swift the cloud of glory came,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
God proclaiming in the thunder

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Jesus as His Son by name;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Nations cry aloud in wonder!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Refrain:

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is God’s beloved Son:

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Law and prophets fade before Him;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
First and last, the only One,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let creation now adore Him.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Refrain:

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
