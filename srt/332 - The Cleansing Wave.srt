1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh now I see the crimson wave,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The fountain deep and wide;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Points to His wounded side.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The cleansing stream I see, I see,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I plunge, and O, it cleanseth me!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O praise the Lord! it cleanseth me,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I see the new creation rise,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I hear the speaking blood;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It speaks polluted nature dies,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Sinks ‘neath the cleansing flood.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I rise to walk in heaven’s own light,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Above the world and sin;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
With heart made pure and garments white,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And Christ enthroned within.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Amazing grace! ’tis heaven below

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
To feel the blood applied,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And Jesus, only Jesus, know,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
My Jesus crucified.
