1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Teach, me, Father, what to say;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Teach me, Father, how to pray;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Teach me all along the way

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How to be like Jesus.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I would be like Jesus,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I would be like Jesus!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Help me, Lord, to daily grow

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
More and more like Jesus!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Teach me as the days go by,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Teach me not to reason why,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Teach me that to do and die,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Is to be like Jesus.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Teach me that the time is short,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Teach me how to live and work,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Teach me that to never shirk

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Is to be like Jesus.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Teach me how we may be one,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Like the Father and the Son;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And when all is overcome,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I will be like Jesus.
