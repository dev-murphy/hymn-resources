1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Ten thousand times ten thousand,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In sparkling raiment bright,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The armies of the ransomed saints

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Throng up the steeps of light.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
‘Tis finished, all is finished,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Their fight with death and sin.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Fling open wide the golden gates,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And let the victors in.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What rush of hallelujahs

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Fills all the earth and sky!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The ringing of a thousand harps

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Proclaims the triumph high.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O day for which creation

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And all its tribes were made!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
O joy, for all its former woes

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
A thousandfold repaid!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O then what raptured greetings

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
On Canaan’s happy shore!

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What knitting severed friendship where

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Death partings are no more!

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Then eyes with joy shall sparkle,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That brimmed with tears of late;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Orphans no longer fatherless,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Nor widows desolate.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Bring near Thy great salvation,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Thou Lamb for sinners slain,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Fill up the roll of Thine elect,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Then take Thy power and reign!

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Appear, Desire of nations,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Thine exiles long for home;

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Show in the heavens Thy promised sign;

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Thou Prince and Savior come!
