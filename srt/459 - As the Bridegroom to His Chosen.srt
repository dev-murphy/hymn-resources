1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
As the bridegroom to His chosen,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
As the king to His realm,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
As the keep unto the castle,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
As the pilot to the helm,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So, Lord, art Thou to me.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
As the fountain in the garden,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
As the candle in the dark,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
As the treasure in the coffer,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
As the manna in the ark,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So, Lord, art Thou to me.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
As the ruby in the setting,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
As the honey in the comb,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
As the light within the lantern,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
As the father in the home,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So, Lord, art Thou to me.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
As the sunshine in the heavens,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
As the image in the glass,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
As the fruits up in the fig tree,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
As the dew upon the grass,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So, Lord, art Thou to me.
