1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I love thy kingdom, Lord,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the house of thine abode,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the church our blest Redeemer saved

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
with his own precious blood.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I love thy church, O God!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Her walls before thee stand

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
dear as the apple of thine eye,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and graven on thy hand.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Beyond my highest joy

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I prize her heavenly ways,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
her sweet communion, solemn vows,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
her hymns of love and praise.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sure as thy truth shall last,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
to Zion shall be given

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
the brightest glories earth can yield,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and brighter bliss of heaven.
