1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I come with joy to meet my Lord,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Forgiven, loved and free,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In awe and wonder to recall

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
His life laid down for me,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
His life laid down for me.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I come with Christians far and near

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
To find, as all are fed,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Our true community of love

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
In Christ’s communion bread,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In Christ’s communion bread.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
As Christ breaks bread for us to share

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Each proud division ends.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That love that made us makes us one,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And strangers now are friends,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And strangers now are friends.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And thus with joy we meet our Lord.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
His presence always near,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Is in such friendship better known:

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We see and praise Him here,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We see and praise Him here.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Together met, together bound,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We’ll go our diff’rent ways,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And as His people in the world,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We’ll live and speak His praise,

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We’ll live and speak His praise.
