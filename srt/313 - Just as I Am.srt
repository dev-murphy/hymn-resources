1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Just as I am, without one plea,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But that Thy blood was shed for me,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Just as I am, and waiting not

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To rid my soul of one dark blot,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Just as I am, though tossed about

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
With many a conflict, many a doubt,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
“Fightings within, and fears without,”

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yea, all I need in Thee to find,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Because Thy promise I believe,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Just as I am, Thy love I own

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Has broken every barrier down;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Now, to be Thine, and Thine alone,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
