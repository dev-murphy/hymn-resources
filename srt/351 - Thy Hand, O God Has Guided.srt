1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Thy hand, O God, has guided

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thy flock from age to age;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The wondrous tale is written

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Full clear on every page;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Our fathers owned Thy goodness,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And we their deeds record;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And both of this bear witness,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
One church, one faith, one Lord.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thy heralds brought glad tidings

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To greatest as to least;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
They bade men rise and hasten

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To share the great King’s feast:

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And this was all their teaching,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In every deed and word,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To all alike proclaiming

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
One church, one faith, one Lord.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
When shadows thick were falling,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And all seemed sunk in night,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Thou, Lord, did send Thy servants,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Thy chosen sons of light.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
On them and on Thy people

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Thy plenteous grace was poured,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And this was still their message:

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
One church, one faith, one Lord.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Thy mercy will not fail us,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Nor leave Thy work undone;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
With Thy right hand to help us,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The vict’ry shall be won;

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And then by men and angels

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Thy name shall be adored,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And this shall be their anthem:

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
One church, one faith, one Lord.
