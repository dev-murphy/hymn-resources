1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord of all being, throned afar,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thy glory flames from sun and star;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Center and soul of every sphere

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yet to each loving heart how near!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yet to each loving heart how near!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Sun of our life, Thy quickening ray

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Shed on our path the glow of day;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Star of our hope, Thy softened light

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Cheers the long watches of the night,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Cheers the long watches of the night.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Our midnight is Thy smile withdrawn;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Our noontide is Thy gracious dawn;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Our rainbow arch, Thy mercy’s sign;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
All, save the clouds of sin, are Thine,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All, save the clouds of sin, are Thine.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Lord of all life, below, above

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Whose light is truth, whose warmth is love,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Before Thy ever-blazing throne

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We ask no luster of our own,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We ask no luster of our own.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Grant us Thy truth to make us free

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And kindling hearts that burn for Thee;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Till all Thy living altars claim

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
One holy light, one heavenly flame!

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
One holy light, one heavenly flame.
