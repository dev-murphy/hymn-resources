1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
He leadeth me: O blessed thought!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
O words with heavenly comfort fraught!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Whate’er I do, where’er I be,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
still ’tis God’s hand that leadeth me.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He leadeth me, he leadeth me,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
by his own hand he leadeth me;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
his faithful follower I would be,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
for by his hand he leadeth me.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sometimes mid scenes of deepest gloom,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
sometimes where Eden’s bowers bloom,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
by waters still, o’er troubled sea,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
still ’tis his hand that leadeth me.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Lord, I would place my hand in thine,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
nor ever murmur nor repine;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
content, whatever lot I see,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
since ’tis my God that leadeth me.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And when my task on earth is done,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
when by thy grace the victory’s won,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
e’en death’s cold wave I will not flee,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
since God through Jordan leadeth me.
