1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and time shall be no more,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
When the saved of earth shall gather

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
over on the other shore,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And the roll is called up yonder, I値l be there.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When the roll is called up yonder,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
When the roll is called up yonder,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
When the roll is called up yonder,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When the roll is called up yonder, I値l be there.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
On that bright and cloudless morning,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
when the dead in Christ shall rise,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And the glory of His resurection share;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
When His chosen ones shall gather

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
to their home beyond the skies,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And the roll is called up yonder, I値l be there.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let us labor for the Master

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
from the dawn till setting sun,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Then, when all of life is over,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and our work on earth is done,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And the roll is called up yonder I値l be there.
