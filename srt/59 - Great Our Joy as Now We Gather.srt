1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Great our joy as now we gather

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Where the Master makes us one:

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Where we worship God the Father

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thro’ the Spirit of His Son.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
All who search for His church

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Find it where His will is done.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Precious is the tie that binds us

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To our God when faith grows cold;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Precious all that now reminds us

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He is still our safe stronghold.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Faithful love serves to prove

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Here the Shepherd has His fold.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
May we learn from Christ’s example

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
How to use this house of prayer:

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He who loved and cleansed His temple

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Wants us all to worship there.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
God the Son shuts out none:

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In His kingdom all may share.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Lord, inspire us with Your vision

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Of a world which must be won!

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Glorious is the church’s mission,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Long endeavoured, scarce begun!

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Faithful now – this is how

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
God’s eternal will is done.
