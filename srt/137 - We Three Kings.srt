1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We three kings of Orient are;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Bearing gifts we traverse afar

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Following yonder star.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O star of wonder, star of night,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Star with royal beauty bright,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Westward leading, still proceeding,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Guide us to Thy perfect light.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Born a King on Bethlehem’s plain,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Gold I bring to crown Him again,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
King forever, ceasing never

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Over us all to reign.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Frankincense to offer have I;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Incense owns a Deity nigh;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Prayer and praising all men raising,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Worship Him, God on high.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Myrrh is mine; its bitter perfume

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Breathes a life of gathering gloom:

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Sealed in the stonecold tomb.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Glorious now behold Him arise,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
King and God and sacrifice;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Alleluia, Alleluia!

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Sounds through the earth and skies.
