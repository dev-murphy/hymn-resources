00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord, bless our homes with peace and love and laughter,

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
With understanding and with loyalty.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
May we together follow Christ the Master

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And know the blessing of His sov’reignty.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
May every heart receive His loving spirit

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And know the t4ruth that makes life truly free;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Then, in that spirit may we live united,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And find in God our deep security.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Forgive the hurts our selfishness inflicted

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
On whose we love and those who love us best.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Christ, heal the scars and draw us all together

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In Him whose will is peace and joy and rest.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Father, in gratitude for homes and loved one,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We open now our hearts to all mankind.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Grand us Your spirit love for one another

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So in Your peace may we our concord find.
