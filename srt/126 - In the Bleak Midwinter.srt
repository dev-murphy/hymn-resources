1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the bleak midwinter

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Frosty wind made moan;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Earth stood hard as iron,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Water like a stone;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Snow had fallen, snow on snow,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Snow on snow,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
In the bleak midwinter,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Long ago.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Angels and archangels

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
May have gathered there,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Cherubim and seraphim

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thronged the air:

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But His mother only

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In her maiden bliss,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Worshipped the beloved

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
With a kiss.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What can I give Him,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Poor as I am?

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If I were a shepherd

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I would bring a lamb;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
If I were a wise man

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I would do my part;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yet what can I give Him?

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Give my heart.
