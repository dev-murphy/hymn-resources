1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Guide me, O thou great Jehovah,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
pilgrim through this barren land.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I am weak, but thou art mighty;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
hold me with thy powerful hand.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Bread of heaven, bread of heaven,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
feed me till I want no more;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
feed me till I want no more.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Open now the crystal fountain,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
whence the healing stream doth flow;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
let the fire and cloudy pillar

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
lead me all my journey through.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Strong deliverer, strong deliverer,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
be thou still my strength and shield;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
be thou still my strength and shield.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When I tread the verge of Jordan,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
bid my anxious fears subside;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
death of death and hell’s destruction,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
land me safe on Canaan’s side.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Songs of praises, songs of praises,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I will ever give to thee;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I will ever give to thee.
