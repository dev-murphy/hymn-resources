1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Crowning jewel of creation,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Blest and hallowed, sanctified;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Time and changes all transcending,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Shared forever, glorified.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Blessed Sabbath made for man,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Gift from the Creator’s hand.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sin and sickness, prayer and weeping

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Cease at close of earthly days;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But Thy Sabbath is eternal,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Joyful thanks to Thee we raise!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Teach us Lord, in storm or sunshine

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
How to truly rest in Thee,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
May Thy Sabbath peace enfold us

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And our shelter ever be.
