1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Sometimes I hear strange music,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Like none e’er heard before,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Come floating softly earthward

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
As thro’ heav’n’s open door:

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It seems like angel voices,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In strains of and love,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That swell the mighty chorus

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Around the throne above.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O sweet, celestial music,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Heard from a land afar-

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The song of Heav’n and Homeland,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thro’ doors God leaves ajar!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Now soft, and low, and restful,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It floods my soul with peace,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
As if God’s benediction

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Bade all earth’s troubles cease.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Then grander than the voices,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Of wind, and wave, and sea-

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It fills the dome of heaven

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
With glorious harmony.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This music haunts me ever,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Like something heard in dreams-

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It seems to catch the cadence

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Of heav’nly winds and streams,

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
My heart is filled with rapture,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
To think, some day to come,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I’ll sing it with the angels-

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The song of heav’n and home.
