1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus, with Thy church abide;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Be her Savior, Lord, and Guide,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
While on earth her faith is tried:

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We beseech Thee, hear us.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
May her voice be ever clear,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Warning of a judgment near,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Telling of a Savior dear:

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We beseech Thee, hear us.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
May she guide the poor and blind,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Seek the lost until she find,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And the broken hearted bind:

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We beseech Thee, hear us.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
May she holy triumps win,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Overthrow the hosts of sin,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Gather all the nations in:

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We beseech Thee, hear us.
