1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus! what a Friend for sinners!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Jesus! Lover of my soul;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Friends may fail me, foes assail me,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He, my Savior, makes me whole.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hallelujah! what a Savior!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hallelujah! what a Friend!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Saving, helping, keeping, loving,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He is with me to the end.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Jesus! what a Strength in weakness!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let me hide myself in Him.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Tempted, tried, and sometimes failing,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He, my Strength, my victory wins.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Jesus! what a Help in sorrow!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
While the billows over me roll,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Even when my heart is breaking,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He, my Comfort, helps my soul.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Jesus! I do now receive Him,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
[or Jesus! I do now adore Him,]

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
More than all in Him I find.

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He hath granted me forgiveness,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I am His, and He is mine.
