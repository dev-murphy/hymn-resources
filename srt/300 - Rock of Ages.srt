1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let me hide myself in Thee;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let the water and the blood,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
From Thy riven side which flowed,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Be of sin the double cure,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Not the labor of my hands

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Can fulfill Thy law’s demands;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Could my zeal no respite know,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Could my tears forever flow,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All for sin could not atone;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thou must save, and Thou alone.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
When my pilgrimage I close;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Victor o’er the last of foes,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When I soar to worlds unknown,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And behold Thee on Thy throne,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let me hide myself in Thee.
