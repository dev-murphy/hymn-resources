1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O God of light, Your Word, a lamp unfailing,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Shall pierce the darkness of our earthbound way

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And show Your grace,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Your plan for us unveiling,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And guide our footsteps to the perfect day.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
From days of old, through blind and willful ages,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Though we rebelled, You gently sought again,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And spoke through saints,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Apostles, prophets, sages,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who wrote with eager or reluctant pen.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Undimmed by time, those words are still revealing

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To sinful hearts Your justice and Your grace;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And questing mortals longing for Your healing,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
See Your compassion in the Savior’s face.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To all the world Your summons You are sending,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Through all the earth, to ever land and race,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That myriad tongues, in one great anthem blending,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
May praise and celebrate Your gift of grace.
