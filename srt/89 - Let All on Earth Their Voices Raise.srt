1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let all on earth their voices raise,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To sing the great Jehovah’s praise,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And bless His holy name:

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
His glory let the people know,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
His wonders to the nations show,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
His saving grace proclaim.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He framed the globe; He built the sky;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He made the shining worlds on high,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And reigns in glory there:

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
His beams are majesty and light;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
His beauties, how divinely bright!

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
His dwelling place, how fair!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Come, the great day, the glorious hour,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
When earth shall feel His saving power,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All nations fear His name;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Then shall the race of men confess

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The beauty of His holiness,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
His saving grace proclaim.
