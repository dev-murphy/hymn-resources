1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Take the world, but give me Jesus;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All its Joys are but a name,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But His love abideth ever,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Through eternal years the same.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh, the height and depth of mercy!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, the length and breadth of love!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, the fullness of redemption,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Pledge of endless life above.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Take the world, but give me Jesus,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Sweetest comfort of my soul;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
With my Savior watching o’er me,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I can sing, though billows roll.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Take the world, but give me Jesus;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let me view his constant smile;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then throughout my pilgrim journey

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Light will cheer me all the while.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Take the world, but give me Jesus;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In His cross my trust shall be,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Till, with clearer, brighter vision

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Face to face my Lord I see.
