1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There is a balm in Gilead

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To make the wounded whole;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There is a balm in Gilead

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To heal the sin-sick soul.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sometimes I feel discouraged,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And think my work’s in vain,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But then the Holy Spirit

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Revives my soul again.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If you can not preach like Peter,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If you can not pray like Paul,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You can tell the love of Jesus,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And say He died for all.
