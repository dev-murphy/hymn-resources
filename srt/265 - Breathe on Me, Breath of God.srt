1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Breathe on me, breath of God,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Fill me with life anew,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That I may love what Thou dost love,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And do what Thou wouldst do.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Breathe on me, breath of God,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Until my heart is pure,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Until with Thee I will one will,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To do and to endure.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Breathe on me, breath of God,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Till I am wholly Thine,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Until this earthly part of me

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Glows with Thy fire divine.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Breathe on me, breath of God,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So shall I constant be,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And live with Thee the perfect life

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Of Thine eternity.
