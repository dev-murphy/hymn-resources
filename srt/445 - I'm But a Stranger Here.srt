1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I知 but a stranger here,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Heav地 is my home;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Earth is a desert drear,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Heav地 is my home.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Danger and sorrow stand

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Round me on every hand;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Heav地 is my fatherland,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Heav地 is my home.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What though the tempest rage,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Heav地 is my home;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Short is my pilgrimage,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Heav地 is my home;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And time痴 wild wintry blast

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Soon shall be over past;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I shall reach home at last,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Heav地 is my home.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
There at my Savior痴 side

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Heav地 is my home;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I shall be glorified,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Heav地 is my home;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
There are the good and blest,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Those I love most and best;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And there I, too, shall rest,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Heav地 is my home.
