1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There is a Name I love to hear,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I love to sing its worth;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It sounds like music in my ears,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The sweetest Name on earth.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O how I love Jesus,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
O how I love Jesus,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O how I love Jesus,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Because He first loved me.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It tells me of a Savior’s love,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who died to set me free;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It tells me of a Savior’s blood,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The sinners’ perfect plea.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It tells of one whose loving heart

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Can feel my deepest woe;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Who in each sorrow bears

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
A part that none can bear below.
