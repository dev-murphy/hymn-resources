1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Waiting for the harvest and the time of reaping –

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Fearing neither clouds nor winter’s chilling breeze;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
By and by the harvest and the labor ended –

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We shall come rejoicing, bringin in the sheaves.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Going forth with weeping, sowing for the Master,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Tho the loss sustained our spirit often grieves;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When our weeping’s over He will bid us welcome –

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves
