1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Look upon Jesus, sinless is He;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Father, impute His life unto me.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Cover with His life, whiter than snow.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Cover with His life, whiter than snow;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Fullness of His life then shall I know;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Cover with His life, whither than snow.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Deep are the wounds transgression has made;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Red are the stains; my soul is afraid.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
O to be covered, Jesus, with Thee,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Safe from the law that now judgeth me!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Longing the joy of pardon to know;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Jesus holds out a robe white as snow;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
“Lord, I accept it! Leaving my own,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Gladly I wear Thy pure life alone.”

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Reconciled by His death for my sin,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Justified by His life pure and clean,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Sanctified by obeying His word,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Glorified when returneth my Lord.
