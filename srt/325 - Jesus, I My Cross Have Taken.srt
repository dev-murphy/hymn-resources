1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus, I my cross have taken, all to leave and follow Thee.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All things else I have forsaken, Thou from hence my all shall be.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Perish every fond ambition, all I’ve sought or hoped or known.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yet how rich is my condition! God and Heaven are still mine own.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let the world despise and leave me, they have left my Savior, too.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Human hearts and looks deceive me; Thou art faithful, Thou art true.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O, ‘tis not in grief to harm me, while thy love is left to me;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O, ‘twere not in joy to charm me, If that love be hid from me.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Soul, then know thy full salvation; rise o’er sin, and fear, and care;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Joy to find in every station something still to do or bear:

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Think what Spirit dwells within thee; Think what Father’s smiles are thine;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Think that Jesus died to win thee, child of heaven, canst thou repine?

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Haste then on from grace to glory, armed by faith, and winged by prayer,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Heaven’s eternal day’s before thee, God’s own hand shall guide thee there.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Soon shall close thy earthly mission, soon shall pass thy pilgrim days;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Hope soon change to glad fruition, faith to sight, and prayer to praise.
