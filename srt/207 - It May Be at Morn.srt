1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It may be at morn, when the day is awaking,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When sunlight through darkness and shadow is breaking,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That Jesus will come in the fullness of glory

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To receive from the world His own.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O Lord Jesus, how long, how long

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Ere we shout the glad song?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Christ returneth, Hallelujah!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hallelujah! Amen, Hallelujah! Amen.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It may be at midday, it may be at twilight,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It may be, perchance, that the blackness of midnight

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
When Jesus receives His own.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O joy! O delight! should we go without dying,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No sickness, no sadness, no dread, and no crying,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Caught up through the clouds with our Lord into glory,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
When Jesus receives His own.
