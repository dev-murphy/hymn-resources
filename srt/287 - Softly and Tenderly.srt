1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
calling for you and for me;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
see, on the portals he’s waiting and watching,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
watching for you and for me.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Come home, come home;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
ye who are weary come home;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
calling, O sinner, come home!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Why should we tary when Jesus is pleading,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
pleading for you and for me?

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why should we linger and heed not his mercies,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
mercies for you and for me?

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Think of the wonderful love he has promised,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
promised for you and for me!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Though we have sinned, he has mercy and pardon,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
pardon for you and for me.
