00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus, priceless Treasure, Source of purest pleasure, Truest Friend to me:

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Ah! how long I’ve panted, And my heart has fainted, thirsting, Lord, for Thee.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Thine I am, O spotless Lamb, I will suffer naught to hide Thee,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Nought I ask beside Thee.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In Thine arms I rest me; foes who would molest me Cannot reach me here.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Though the earth be shaking, Every heart be quaking, Jesus calms our fear.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sin and hell in conflict fell, With their bitter storms assail me,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Jesus will not fail me.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hence, all thought of sadness! For the Lord of gladness, Jesus, enters in.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Those who love the Father, Though the storms may gather, still have peace within;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yea, whatever we here must bear, Still in Thee lies purest pleasure,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Jesus, priceless Treasure!
