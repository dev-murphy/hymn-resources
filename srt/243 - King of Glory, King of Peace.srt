1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
King of glory, King of peace, I will love Thee;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And that love may never cease, I will move Thee.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Thou hast granted my request, Thou hast heard me;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thou didst note my working breast, Thou hast spared me.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Wherefore with my utmost art I will sing Thee,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And the cream of all my heart I will bring Thee.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Though my sins against me cried, Thou didst clear me;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And alone, when they replied, Thou didst hear me.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Seven whole days, not one in seven, I will praise Thee;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In my heart, though not in heav’n I can raise Thee.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Small it is, in this poor sort to enroll Thee:

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Ev’n eternity’s too short to extol Thee.
