1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the heart of Jesus there is love for you,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Love most pure and tender, love most deep and true;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Why should you be lonely, why for friendship sigh,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
When the heart of Jesus has a full supply?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In the mind of Jesus there is thought for you,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Warm as summer sunshine, sweet as morning dew;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Why should you be fearful, why take anxious thought,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Since the mind of Jesus cares for those He bought?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
In the field of Jesus there is work for you;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Such as even angels might rejoice to do;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why stand idly sighing for some lifework grand,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
While the field of Jesus seeks your reaping hand?

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In the home of Jesus there’s a place for you;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Glorious, bright, and joyous, calm and peaceful too;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Why then, like a wanderer, roam with weary pace,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If the home of Jesus holds for you a place?
