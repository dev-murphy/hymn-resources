1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus, stand among us

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In Thy risen power;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let this time of worship

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Be a hallowed hour.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Breathe the Holy Spirit

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Into every heart;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Bid the fears and sorrows

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
From each soul depart.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thus with quickened footsteps

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We pursue our way,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Watching for the dawning

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Of eternal day.
