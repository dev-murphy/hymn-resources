1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Ride on! ride on in majesty!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hark, all the tribes hosanna cry;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
O Savior meek, pursue Thy road

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
With palms and scattered garments strowed.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Ride on! ride on in majesty!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In lowly pomp ride on to die;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O Christ, Thy triumphs now begin

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O’er captive death and conquered sin.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Ride on! ride on in majesty!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The winged squadrons of the sky

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Look down with sad and wondering eyes

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To see the approaching sacrifice.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Ride on! ride on in majesty!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In lowly pomp ride on to die;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Bow Thy meek head to mortal pain,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Then take, O God, Thy power and reign.
