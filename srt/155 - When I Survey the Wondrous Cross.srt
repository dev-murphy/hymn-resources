1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When I survey the wondrous cross

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
On which the Prince of glory died,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My richest gain I count but loss,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And pour contempt on all my pride.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
See, from His head, His feet,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet?

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Since I, who was undone and lost,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Have pardon through His name and word;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Forbid it, then, that I should boast,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Save in the cross of Christ my Lord.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Were the whole realm of nature mine,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That were a tribute far too small;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Love so amazing, so divine,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Demands my life, my soul, my all.
