1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the blood from the cross,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I have been washed from sin;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But to be free from dross,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Still I would enter in.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Deeper yet, deeper yet,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Into the crimson flood;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Deeper yet, deeper yet,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Under the precious blood.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Day by day, hour by hour,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Blessings are sent to me;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But for more of His power,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Ever my prayer shall be.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Near to Christ I would live,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Following Him each day;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What I ask He will give;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So then with faith I pray.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Now I have peace, sweet peace,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
While in this world of sin;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But to pray I’ll not cease

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Till I am pure within.
