1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I am going to Calvary,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Would you like to come with Me

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All the way and back again?

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You must follow the Leader then.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You must follow the Leader,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You must follow the Leader,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
All the way and back again,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You must follow the Leader.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If I want a thorny crown,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If the soldiers knock me down

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Can I really be a king?

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Love will answer everything

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If you follow the Leader,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you follow the Leader,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Love will answer everything,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If you follow the Leader.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
When I go along the road,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I shall lift a heavy load.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I will carry a cross for you.

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You will learn to carry it too

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
When you follow the Leader,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
When you follow the Leader,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You will learn to carry it too

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
When you follow the Leader.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I am going to stretch My hands,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Reaching out to all the lands.

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Can I really be a king?

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Love’s the lord of everything,

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
When you follow the Leader,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
When you follow the Leader

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Love’s the lord of everything,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
When you follow the Leader.
