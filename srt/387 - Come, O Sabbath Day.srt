1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Peace and healing on thy wing;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And to every troubled breast

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Speak of the divine behest:

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thou shalt rest, Thou shalt rest!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Earthly longings bid retire,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Quench the passions’ hurtful fire;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
To the wayward, sin oppressed,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Bring thou thy divine behest:

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thou shalt rest, Thou shalt rest!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Wipe from every cheek the tear,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Banish care and silence fear;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All things working for the best,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Teach us the divine behest:

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Thou shalt rest, Thou shalt rest!
