1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord Jesus, think on me, And purge away my sin;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
From earth-born passions set me free, And make me pure within.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Lord Jesus, think on me, With care and woe oppressed;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let me Thy loving servant be, And taste Thy promised rest.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Lord Jesus, think on me, Nor let me go astray;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Through darkness and perplexity Point Thou the heavenly way.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Lord Jesus, think on me, That I may sing above

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To Father, Spirit, and to Thee, The strains of praise and love.
