1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In heavenly love abiding, No change my heart shall fear;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And safe is such confiding, For nothing changes here.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The storm may roar without me, My heart may low be laid;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But God is round about me, And can I be dismayed?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Wherever He may guide me, No want shall turn me back;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
My Shepherd is besided me, And nothing can I lack.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
His wisdom ever waketh, His sight is never dim;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He knows the way He taketh, And I will walk with Him.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Green pastures are before me, Which yet I have not seen;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Bright skies will soon be o’er me, Where darkest clouds have been.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My hope I cannot measure, My path to life is free;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
My Savior has my teasure, And He will walk with me.
