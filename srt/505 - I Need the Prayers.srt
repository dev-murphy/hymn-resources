1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I need the prayers of those I love,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
While trav’ling o’er life’s rugged way,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That I may true and faithful be,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And live for Jesus every day.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I want my friends to pray for me,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To bear my tempted soul above,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And intercede with God for me;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I need the prayers of those I love.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I need the prayers of those I love,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To help me in each trying hour,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
To bear my tempted sould to Him,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That He may keep me by His pow’r.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I want my friends to pray for me,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To hold me up on wing of faith,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That I may walk the narrow way,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Kept by our Father’s glorious grace.
