1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
While shepherds watched their flocks by night,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All seated on the ground,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The angel of the Lord came down,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And glory shone around.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
“Fear nor!” said he- for mighty dread

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Had seized their troubled mind-

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
“Glad tidings of great joy I bring,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To you and all mankind.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
“To you, in David’s town this day,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Is born of David’s line,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The Savior who is Christ the Lord;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And this shall be the sign:

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
“The heavenly Babe you there shall find

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To human view displayed,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And in a manger laid.”

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thus spake the seraph; and forth with

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Appeared a shining throng

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Of angels praising God on high,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Who thus addressed their song:

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
“All glory be to God on high,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And to the earth be peace;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Good will henceforth from heaven to men,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Begin and never cease!”
