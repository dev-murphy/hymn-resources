1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord of all nations, grant me grace

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To love all people, every race,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And in each person may I see

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
My kindred loved, redeemed by Thee.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Break down the wall that would divide

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thy children, Lord, on every side.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
My neighbor’s good let me pursue;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let Christian love bind warm and true.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Forgive me, Lord, where I have erred

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
By loveless act and thoughtless word.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Make me to see the wrong I do

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Will crucify my Lord anew.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Give me Thy courage, Lord, to speak

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Whenever strong oppress the weak.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Should I myself the victim be,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Help me forgive, remembering Thee.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
With Thine own love may I be filled

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And by Thy Holy Spirit willed,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That all I touch, where’er I be,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
May be divinely touched by Thee.
