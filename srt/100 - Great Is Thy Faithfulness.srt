1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There is no shadow of turning with Thee;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
As Thou hast been, Thou forever will be.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Great is Thy faithfulness!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Great is Thy faithfulness!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Morning by morning new mercies I see.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Summer and winter and springtime and harvest,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Sun, moon and stars in their courses above

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Join with all nature in manifold witness

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!
