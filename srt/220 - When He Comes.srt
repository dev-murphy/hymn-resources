1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When He comes,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When He comes,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We shall see the Lord in glory when He comes!

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
As I read the gospel story,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We shall see the Lord in glory,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We shall see the Lord in glory when He comes!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
With the alleluias ringing to the sky,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
With the alleluias ringing to the sky!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
As I read the gospel in glory,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We shall see the Lord in glory,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
With the alleluias ringing in the sky!

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
When He comes,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
When He comes,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We shall hear the trumpet sounded when He comes!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We shall hear the trumpet sounded,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
See the Lord by saints surrounded,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We shall hear the trumpet sounded when He comes!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
When He comes,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
When He comes,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We shall all rise up to meet Him when He comes!

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We shall all rise up to meet Him,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
When He calls His own to greet Him

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We shall all rise up to meet Him when He comes!
