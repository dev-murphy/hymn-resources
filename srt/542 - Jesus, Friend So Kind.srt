00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus, Friend, so kind and gentle,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Little ones we bring to Thee:

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Grant to them Thy dearest blessing,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let Thine arms around them be;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now enfold them in Thy goodness,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
From all danger keep them free.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thou who did receive the children

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To Thyself so tenderly,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Give to all who teach and guide them

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Wisdom and humility.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Vision true to keep them noble,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Love to serve them faithfully.
