1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Every flow’r that grows, Every brook that flows,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Tell of beauty God has giv’n for me:

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Throughout my life may beauty be

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Deep within a heart from sin set free.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Gracious Lord above, Looking down in love,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Guide my thoughts, my life, in my walk with Thee,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That day by day the world may see

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Christ, the Lord and Savior, lives in me.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
All my earthly days, I shall sing and praise

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
God the Father, Spirit, and Christ with the Son.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Grant faith when life on earth is done,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I shall sing with those whose rest is won.
