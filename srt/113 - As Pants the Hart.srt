1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
As pants the hart for cooling streams

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When heated in the chase,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So longs my soul, O God, for Thee,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And Thy refreshing grace.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
For Thee, my God, the living God,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
My thirsty soul doth pine:

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O when shall I behold Thy face,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thou Majesty divine?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Why restless, why cast down, my soul?

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hope still, and thou shalt sing

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The praise of Him who is thy God,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thy health’s eternal spring.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The God whom we adore,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Be glory, as it was, is now,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And shall be evermore.
