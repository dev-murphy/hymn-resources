1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is my Father’s world,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and to my listening ears

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
all nature sings, and round me rings

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the music of the spheres.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is my Father’s world:

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I rest me in the thought

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
his hand the wonders wrought.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is my Father’s world,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the birds their carols raise,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the morning light, the lily white,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
declare their maker’s praise.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is my Father’s world:

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
he shines in all that’s fair;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
in the rustling grass I hear him pass;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
he speaks to me everywhere.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This is my Father’s world.

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
O let me ne’er forget

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
that though the wrong seems oft so strong,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
God is the ruler yet.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This is my Father’s world:

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
why should my heart be sad?

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The Lord is King; let the heavens ring!

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
God reigns; let the earth be glad!
