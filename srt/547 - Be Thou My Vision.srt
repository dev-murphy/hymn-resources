1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Riches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thou mine Inheritance, now and always:

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
High King of Heaven, my victory won,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
May I reach Heaven’s joys, O bright Heaven’s Sun!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.
