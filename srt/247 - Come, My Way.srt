1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come, my Way, my Truth, my Life:

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
such a way as gives us breath,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
such a truth as ends all strife,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
such a life as killeth death.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Come, my Light, my Feast, my Strength:

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
such a light as shows a feast,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
such a feast as mends in length,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
such a strength as makes his guest.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Come, my Joy, my Love, my Heart:

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
such a joy as none can move,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
such a love as none can part,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
such a heart as joys in love.
