1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I Will sing of Jesus love,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Sing of Him,who first loved me;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
for He left bright worlds above,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And died on Calvary.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I will sing of Jesus love

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Endless praise my heart shall give;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He has died that I might live

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I will sing His love to me.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O the depths of love divine!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Earth or heaven can never know

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
How that sin as dark as mine

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
can be made as white as snow.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Nothing good for Him I’ve done;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
How could He such love bestow?

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Lord, I own my heart is won,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
help me now my love to show.
