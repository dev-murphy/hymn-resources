1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Joy to the world, the Lord is come!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let earth receive her King;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let every heart prepare Him room,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And heaven and nature sing, And heaven and nature sing,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let men their songs employ;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Repeat the sounding joy, Repeat the sounding joy,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No more let sin and sorrow grow,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Nor thorns infest the ground;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He comes to make His blessings flow

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Far as the curse is found, Far as the curse is found,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Far as, far as the curse is found.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He rules the world with truth and grace,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And makes the nations prove

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The glories of His righteousness,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And wonders of His love, And wonders of His love,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And wonders, and wonders of His love.
