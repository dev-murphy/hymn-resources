1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When all my labors and trails are o’er,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And I am safe on that beautiful shore,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Just to be near the Lord I adore,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Will through the ages be glory for me.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O that will be

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
O      that will

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Glory for me, Glory for me,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Be    glory for me,    Glory for me,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Glory for me; When by His grace

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Glory for me;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I shall look on His face,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That will be glory, be glory for me.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
When, by the gift of His infinite grace,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I am accorded in heaven a place,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Just to be there and to look on His face,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Will through the ages be glory for me.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Friends will be there I have loved long ago;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Joy like a river around me will flow,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yet, just a smile form my Savior, I know,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Will through the ages be glory for me.
