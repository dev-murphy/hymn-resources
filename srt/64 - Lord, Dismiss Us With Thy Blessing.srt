00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord, dismiss us with thy blessing;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
fill our hearts with joy and peace;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
let us each, thy love possessing,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
triumph in redeeming grace.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O refresh us, O refresh us,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
traveling through this wilderness.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thanks we give and adoration

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
for thy gospel’s joyful sound.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
May the fruits of thy salvation

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
in our hearts and lives abound;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
ever faithful, ever faithful

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to the truth may we be found.
