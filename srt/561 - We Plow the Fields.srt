1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We plow the fields, and scatter the good seed on the land,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But it is fed and watered by God’s almighty hand.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He sends the snow in winter, the warmth to swell the grain,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The breezes and the sunshine, and soft refreshing rain.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
All good gifts around us

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Are sent from heaven above;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Then thank the Lord, O thank the Lord

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
For all His love.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He only is the Maker of all things near and far;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He paints the wayside flower, He lights the evening star.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The winds and waves obey Him, by Him the birds are fed;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Much more, to us His children, He gives our daily bread.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We thank Thee then, O Father, for all things bright and good,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The seed-time and the harvest, our life, our health, and food.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Accept the gifts we to offer for all Thy love imparts,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And, what Thou most desirest, our humble, thankful hearts.
