1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come, we that love the Lord,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And let our joys be known;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Join in a song with sweet accord,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Join in a song with sweet accord,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And thus surround the throne,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And thus surround the throne.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We’re marching to Zion,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We’re marching upward to Zion,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The beautiful city of God.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let those refuse to sing

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Who never knew our God;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But children of the heav’nly King,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But children of the heav’nly King

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
May speak their joys abroad,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
May speak their joys abroad.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The hill of Zion yields

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
A thousand sacred sweets

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Before we reach the heav’nly fields,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Before we reach the heav’nly fields

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Or walk the golden streets,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Or walk the golden streets.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Then let our songs abound

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And ev’ry tear be dry;

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We’re marching thru Immanuel’s ground,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We’re marching thru Immanuel’s ground

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
To fairer worlds on high,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
To fairer worlds on high.
