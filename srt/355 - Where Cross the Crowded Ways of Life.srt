1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Where cross the crowded ways of life,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
where sound the cries of race and clan,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
above the noise of selfish strife,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we hear your voice, O Son of Man.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
From tender childhood’s helplessness,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
from woman’s grief, man’s burdened toil,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
from famished souls, from sorrow’s stress,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
your heart has never known recoil.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The cup of water given for you still

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
holds the freshness of your grace;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
yet long these multitudes to view

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the sweet compassion of your face.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O Master, from the mountainside

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
make haste to heal these hearts of pain;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
among these restless throngs abide;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
O tread the city’s streets again.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Till all the world shall learn your love

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and follow where your feet have trod,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
till, glorious from your heaven above,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
shall come the city of our God.
