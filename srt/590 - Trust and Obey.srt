1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When we walk with the Lord

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in the light of his word,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
what a glory he sheds on our way!

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
While we do his good will,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
he abides with us still,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and with all who will trust and obey.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Trust and obey, for there’s no other way

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Not a shadow can rise,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
not a cloud in the skies,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
but his smile quickly drives it away;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
not a doubt nor a fear,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
not a sigh nor a tear,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
can abide while we trust and obey.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Not a burden we bear,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
not a sorrow we share,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
but our toil he doth richly repay;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
not a grief or a loss,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
not a frown or a cross,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
but is blest if we trust and obey.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But we never can prove

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
the delights of his love

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
until all on the altar we lay;

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
for the favor he shows,

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and the joy he bestows,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
are for them who will trust and obey.

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Then in fellowship sweet

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
we will sit at his feet,

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
or we’ll walk by his side in the way;

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
what he says we will do,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
where he sends we will go;

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
never fear, only trust and obey.
