1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O perfect Love, all human thought transcending,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
lowly we kneel in prayer before thy throne,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
that theirs may be the love which knows no ending,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
whom thou forevermore dost join in one.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O perfect Life, be thou their full assurance

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
of tender charity and steadfast faith,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
of patient hope and quiet, brave endurance,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
with childlike trust that fears nor pain nor death.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Grant them the joy which brightens earthly sorrow;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
grant them the peace which calms all earthly strife,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and to life’s day the glorious unknown morrow

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
that dawns upon eternal love and life.
