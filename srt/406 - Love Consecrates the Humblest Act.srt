1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Love consecrates the humblest act

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And haloes mercy’s deeds;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It sheds a benediction sweet

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And hallows human needs.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
When in the shadow of the cross

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Christ knelt and washed the feet

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Of His disciples, He gave us

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A sign of love complete.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Love serves and willing, stoops to serve;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What Christ in love so true

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Has freely done for one and all,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let us now gladly do!
