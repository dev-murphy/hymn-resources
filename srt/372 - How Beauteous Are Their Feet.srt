1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How beauteous are their feet

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Who stand on Zion’s hill;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Who bring salvation on their tongues,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And words of peace reveal!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
How charming is their voice,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So sweet the tidings are:

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
“Zion, behold thy Savior King;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He reigns and triumphs here!”

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How happy are our ears,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That hear the joyful sound

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Which kings and prophets waited for,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And sought, but never found!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
How blessed are our eyes,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That see this heavenly light;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Prophets and kings desired it long,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But died without the sight!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The watchmen join their voice,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And tuneful notes employ;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And deserts learn the joy.
