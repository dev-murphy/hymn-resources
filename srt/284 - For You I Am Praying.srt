1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I have a Savior, He’s pleading in glory,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A dear, loving Savior, though earth friends be few;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And now He is watching in tenderness o’er me,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But oh that my Savior were your Savior, too.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
For you I am praying, For you I am Praying,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For you am I praying, I’m praying for you.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I have a Father; to me He has given

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A hope for eternity, blessed and true;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And soon He will call to meet Him in heaven,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But oh that He’d let me bring you with me, too!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I have a robe; ’tis resplendent in whiteness,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Awaiting in glory my wondering view;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh, when I receive it, all shining in brightness,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Dear friend, could I see you receiving one, too!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When Jesus has found you, tell others the story,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That my loving Savior is your Savior, too;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Then pray that your Savior will bring them to glory,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And prayer will be answered-’twas answered for you!
