1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Infant holy, infant lowly,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For His bed a cattle stall;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oxen lowing, little knowing

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Christ the babe is Lord of all;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Swift are winging angels singing,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Noels ringing, tidings bringing,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Christ the babe is Lord of all,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Christ the babe is Lord of all.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Flocks were sleeping, shepherds keeping

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Vigil till the morning new;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Saw the glory, heard the story,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Tidings of the gospel true;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thus rejoicing, free from sorrow,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Praises voicing greet the morrow,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Christ the babe was born for you,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Christ the babe was born for you.
