1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
To God be the glory, great things he hath done!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So loved he the world that he gave us his Son,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
who yielded his life an atonement for sin,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and opened the lifegate that all may go in.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
let the earth hear his voice!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
let the people rejoice!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O come to the Father thru Jesus the Son,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and give him the glory, great things he hath done!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to every believer the promise of God;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
the vilest offender who truly believes,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that moment from Jesus a pardon receives.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Great things he hath taught us, great things he hath done,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and great our rejoicing thru Jesus the Son;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
but purer, and higher, and greater will be

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.
