1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I am coming to the cross;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I am poor and weak and blind;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I am counting all but dross;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I shall full salvation find.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I am trusting, Lord, in Thee.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
O thou Lamb of Calvary;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Humbly at Thy cross I bow.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Save me, Jesus, save me now.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Long my heart has sighed for Thee;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Long has evil reigned within;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Jesus sweetly speaks to me:

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
“I will cleanse you from all sin.”

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Here I give my all to Thee:

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Friends and time and earthly store;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Soul and body Thine to be,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Wholly Thine forevermore.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Jesus comes! He fills my soul!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Perfected in Him I am;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I am every whit made whole:

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Glory, glory to the Lamb!
