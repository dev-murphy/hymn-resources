There’s no other name like Jesus

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That my fainting spirit cheers.

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If He wills that I should labor

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
In His vineyard day by day,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Then ’tis well if only Jesus

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Blesses all I do or say.

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If He wills that death’s cold finger

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Touch my feeble, mortal clay,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Then ’tis well if only Jesus

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Is my dying trust and stay.
