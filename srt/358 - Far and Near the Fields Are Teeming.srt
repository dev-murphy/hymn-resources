1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Far and near the fields are teeming

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
with the sheaves of ripened grain;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Far and near their gold is gleaming

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
O’er the summy slope and plain.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Lord of harvest, send forth reapers!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hear us Lord,to Thee we cry;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Send them now the sheaves to gather,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Ere the harvest-time pass by.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Send them forth with morn’s first beaming,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Send them in the noon-tides’s glare;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
When the sun’s last rays are streaming,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
bid them gather everywhere.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O thou, whom thy Lord is sending,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
gather now the sheaves of gold;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Heavenward then at evening wending

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thou shalt come with joy untold.
