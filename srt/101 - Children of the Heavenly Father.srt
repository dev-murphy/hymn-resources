1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Children of the heavenly Father

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Safely in His bossom gather;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Nestling bird nor star in heaven

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Such a refuge e’er was given.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
God His own doth tend and nourish,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In His holy love they flourish;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
From all evil things He spares them,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In His mighty arms He bears them.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Neither life nor death shall ever

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
From the Lord His children sever;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Unto them His grace He showeth,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And their sorrows all He knoweth.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Praise the Lord in joyful numbers,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Your Protector never slumbers;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
At the will of your Defender

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Every foe-man must surrender.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Though He giveth or He taketh,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
God His children ne’er forsaketh;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
His the loving purpose solely

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
To preserve them pure and holy.
