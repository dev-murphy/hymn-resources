1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
God the Omnipotent! King, who ordainest

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Great winds Thy clarions, the lightnings Thy sword;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reignest,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Give to us peace, O most merciful Lord.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
God the all merciful! earth hath forsaken

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thy precepts holy, and slighted Thy word;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Bid not Thy wrath in its terrors awaken;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Give to us peace, O most merciful Lord.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
God the all righteousness One! man hath defied Thee;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yet to eternity standeth Thy word;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside Thee;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Prosper the right, O most merciful Lord.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So shall we render Thee thankful devotion,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
For Thy deliverance from peril and sword,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Singing in chorus from ocean to ocean,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
“Thine is the power and the glory, O Lord.”
