00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when our hearts lowly bend,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And we gather to Jesus, our Savior and Friend;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If we come to Him in faith, His protection to share,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Blessed hour of prayer, Blessed hour of prayer,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the Savior draws near,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
With a tender compassion His children to hear;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
When He tells us we may cast at His feet every care,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the tempted and tried

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
To the Savior who loves them their sorrows confide;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
With a sympathizing heart He removes every care;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, trusting Him we believe,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That the blessings we’re needing we’ll surely receive;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In the fullness of this trust we shall lose every care;
