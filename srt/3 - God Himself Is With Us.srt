1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
God Himself is with us;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let us all adore Him,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And with awe appear before Him.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
God is here within us;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Soul, in silence fear Him,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Humbly, fervently draw near Him.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Now His own who have known God,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In worship lowly,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yield their spirits wholly.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Come, abide within me;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let my soul, like Mary,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Be Thine earthly sanctuary.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Come, indwelling Spirit,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
With transfigured splendor;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Love and honor will I render.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Where I go here below,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let me bow before Thee,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Know Thee and adore Thee.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Gladly we surrender

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Earth’s deceitful treasures,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Pride of life and sinful pleasures:

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Gladly, Lord, we offer

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Thine to be forever,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Soul and life and each endeavor.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Thou alone shall be known

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Lord of all our being,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Life’s true way decreeing.
