1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
These children dear of mine, Thou gavest me;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
O, by Thy love divine, Lead them, my God, to Thee;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
When earth looks bright and fair, Festive and gay,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let no delusive snare Lure them astray;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But from temptation’s power, Lead them, my God, to Thee,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
E’en for such little ones, Christ came a child,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And in this world of sin Lived undefiled.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
O, for His sake, I pray, Lead them, my God, to Thee,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yea, though my faith be dim, I would believe

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That Thou this precious gift Wilt now receive;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
O take their young hearts now, Lead them my God to Thee,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.
