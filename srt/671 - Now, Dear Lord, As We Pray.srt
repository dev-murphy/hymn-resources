1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now, dear Lord, as we pray,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
take our hearts and minds far away

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
from the press of the world all around

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
to your throne where grace does abound.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
May our lives be transformed by Your love,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
may our souls be refreshed from above.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
At this moment, let people everywhere

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
join us now as we come to You in prayer.
