1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Love divine, all loves excelling,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
joy of heaven, to earth come down;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
fix in us thy humble dwelling;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
all thy faithful mercies crown!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Jesus thou art all compassion,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
pure, unbounded love thou art;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
visit us with thy salvation;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
enter every trembling heart.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Breathe, O breathe thy loving Spirit

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
into every troubled breast!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let us all in thee inherit;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
let us find the promised rest.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Take away our bent to sinning;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Alpha and Omega be;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
end of faith, as its beginning,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
set our hearts at liberty.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Come, Almighty to deliver,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
let us all thy grace receive;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
suddenly return and never,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
nevermore thy temples leave.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thee we would be always blessing,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
serve thee as thy hosts above,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
pray and praise thee without ceasing,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
glory in thy perfect love.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Finish, then, thy new creation;

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
pure and spotless let us be.

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let us see thy great salvation

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
perfectly restored in thee;

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
changed from glory into glory,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
till in heaven we take our place,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
till we cast our crowns before thee,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
lost in wonder, love, and praise.
