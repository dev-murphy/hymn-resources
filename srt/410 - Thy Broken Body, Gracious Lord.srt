1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Thy broken body, gracious Lord,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Is shadowed by this broken bread;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The wine which in this cup is poured,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Points to the blood which Thou hast shed.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And while we meet together thus,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We show that we are one in Thee;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thy precious blood was shed for us,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thy death, O Lord, hast set us free!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We have one hope that Thou wilt come,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thee in the air we wait to see;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
When Thou wilt give Thy saints a home,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And we shall ever reign with Thee.
