1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
As water to the thirsty,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
As beauty to the eyes,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
As strength that follows weakness,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
As truth instead of lies;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
As song-time and springtime and summertime to be,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So is my Lord, my living Lord,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So is my Lord to me.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Like calm in place of clamor

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Like peace that follows pain,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Like meeting after parting,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Like sunshine after rain;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Like moonlight and starlight and sunlight on the sea,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So is my Lord, my living Lord,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So is my Lord to me.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
As sleep that follows fever,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
As gold instead of grey,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
As freedom after bondage,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
As sunrise to the day;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
As home to the trav’ler and all he longs to see,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So is my Lord, my living Lord,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So is my Lord to me.
