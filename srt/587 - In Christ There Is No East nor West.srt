1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In Christ there is no east nor west,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In Him no south or north;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But one great fellowship of love

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Throughout the whole wide earth.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In Him shall true heart everywhere

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Their high communion find;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
His service is the golden cord

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Close binding all mankind.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Join hands, then, brothers of the faith,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Whate’er your race may be.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Who serves my Father as a son

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Is surely kin to me.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In Christ now meet both east and west,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In Him meet south and north;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All Christly souls are one in Him

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Throughout the whole wide earth.
