1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O, when shall I see Jesus and reign with Him above,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And from the flowing fountain drink everlasting love,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O, shout, glory!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For I shall mount above the skies,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When I hear the trumpet sound in that morning.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Gird on the gospel armor of faith and hope and love,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And you’ll hear the trumpet sound in that morning.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And when the combat’s ended He’ll carry you above,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And you’ll hear the trumpet sound in that morning.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Our ears shall hear with transport the host of heaven sing,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Our tongues shall chant the glories of our immortal King.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning,
