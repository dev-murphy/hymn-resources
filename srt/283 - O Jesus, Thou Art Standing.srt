1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O Jesus, thou art standing,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
outside the fast closed door,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
in lowly patience waiting

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
to pass the threshold o’er:

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O shame, professing Christians,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
his Name and sign who bear,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O shame, thrice shame upon us,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to keep him standing there!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O Jesus, thou art knocking;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and lo, that hand is scarred,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and thorns thy brow encircle,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and tears thy face have marred:

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O love that passeth knowledge,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
so patiently to wait!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
O sin that hath no equal,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
so fast to bar the gate!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O Jesus, thou art pleading

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
in accents meek and low,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
“I died for you, my children,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and will you treat me so?”

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
O Lord, with shame and sorrow

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
we open now the door;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
dear Savior, enter, enter,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and leave us never more.
