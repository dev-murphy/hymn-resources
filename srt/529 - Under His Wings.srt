1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Under His wings I am safely abiding;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Though the night deepens and tempests are wild,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
he has redeemed me, and I am His child.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Under His wings, under His wings,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Who from His love can sever?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Under His wings, my soul shall abide,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Safely abide forever.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How the heart yearningly turns to its rest!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Often when earth has no balm for my healing,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
There I find comfort, and there I am blest.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Under His wings, O what precious enjoyment!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There will I hide till life’s trials are over;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Resting in Jesus I’m safe evermore.
