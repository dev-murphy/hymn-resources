1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Open now thy gates of beauty,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Zion, let me enter there,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Where my soul in joyful duty

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Waits for God Who answers prayer.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh, how blessèd is this place,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Filled with solace, light, and grace!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Gracious God, I come before Thee,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come Thou also unto me;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Where we find Thee and adore Thee,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There a heav’n on earth must be.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
To my heart, oh, enter Thou,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let it be Thy temple now!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Here Thy praise is gladly chanted,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Here Thy seed is duly sown;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let my soul, where it is planted,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Bring forth precious sheaves alone,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So that all I hear may be

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Fruitful unto life in me.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Thou my faith increase and quicken,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Let me keep Thy gift divine,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Howsoe’er temptations thicken;

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
May Thy Word still o’er me shine

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
As my guiding star through life,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
As my comfort in my strife.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Speak, O God, and I will hear Thee,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let Thy will be done indeed;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
May I undisturbed draw near Thee

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
While Thou dost Thy people feed.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Here of life the fountain flows;

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Here is balm for all our woes.
