1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus, Savior, pilot me

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
over life’s tempestuous sea;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
unknown waves before me roll,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
hiding rock and treacherous shoal.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Chart and compass come from thee;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
As a mother stills her child,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
thou canst hush the ocean wild;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
boisterous waves obey thy will,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
when thou sayest to them, “Be still!”

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Wondrous sovreign of the sea,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
When at last I near the shore,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and the fearful breakers roar

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
‘twixt me and the peaceful rest,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
then, while leaning on thy breast,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
may I hear thee say to me,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
“Fear not, I will pilot thee.
