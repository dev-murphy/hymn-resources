1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord, while for all mankind we pray

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Of every clime and coast,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
O hear us for our native land,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The land we love the most!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O guard our shores from every foe,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
With peace our borders bless;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
With prosperous times our cities crown,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Our fields with plenteousness!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Unite us in the sacred love

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Of knowledge, truth, and Thee;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And let our hills and valleys shout

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The songs of liberty.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Lord of the nations, thus to Thee

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Our country we commend;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Be Thou her Refuge and her trust,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Her everlasting friend.
