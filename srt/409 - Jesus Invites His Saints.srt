1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus invites His saints

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To meet around His board,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And sup in memory of the death

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And sufferings of their Lord.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We take the bread and wine

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
As emblems of Thy death;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Lord, raise our souls above the sign,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To feast on Thee by faith.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Faith eats the bread of life,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And drinks the living wine;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It looks beyond this scene of strife

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Unites us to the Vine.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Soon shall the night be gone,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Our Lord will come again;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The marriage supper of the Lamb

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Will usher in His reign.
