1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The spacious firmament on high,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
With all the blue, ethereal sky,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And spangled heavens, a shining frame,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Their great Original proclaim.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Th’unwearied sun from day to day

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Does his Creator’s power display,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And publishes to every land

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The work of an almighty hand

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Soon as the evening shades prevail,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The moon takes up the wondrous tale;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And nightly to the listening earth

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Repeats the story of her birth;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
While all the stars that round her burn,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And all the planets in their turn,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Confirm the tidings as they roll,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And spread the truth from pole to pole

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What though in solemn silence all

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Move round the dark terrestrial ball?

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What though no real voice nor sound

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Amid their radiant orbs be found?

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
In reason’s ear they all rejoice

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And utter forth a glorious voice,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Forever singing as they shine,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
“The hand that made us is divine.”
