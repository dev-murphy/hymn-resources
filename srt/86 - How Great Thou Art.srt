1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O Lord my God

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When I in awesome wonder

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the stars

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I hear the rolling thunder

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thy power throughout the universe displayed

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Then sings my soul

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
My Saviour God to Thee

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How great Thou art

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How great Thou art

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Then sings my soul

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
My Saviour God to Thee

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
How great Thou art

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
How great Thou art

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When through the woods

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And forest glades I wander

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
When I look down

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
From lofty mountain grandeur

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And see the brook and feel the gentle breeze

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And when I think

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That God His Son not sparing

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Sent Him to die I scarce can take it in

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That on the Cross

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
My burden gladly bearing

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He bled and died to take away my sin.

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
When Christ shall come

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
With shouts of acclamation

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And take me home

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What joy shall fill my heart

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Then I shall bow

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
In humble adoration

33
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And there proclaim

34
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:30,000
“My God, how great Thou art!”
