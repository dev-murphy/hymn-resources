1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The King of love my Shepherd is,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Whose goodness faileth never;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I nothing lack if I am His,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And He is mine forever.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Where streams of living water flow

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
My ransomed soul He leadeth,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And, where the verdant pastures grow,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
With food celestial feedeth.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Perverse and foolish, oft I strayed,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But yet in love He sought me,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And on His shoulder gently laid,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And home, rejoicing, brought me.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And so through all the length of days

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Thy goodness faileth never;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Good Shepherd! I would sing Thy praise

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Within Thy house forever.
