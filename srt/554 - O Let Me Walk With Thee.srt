1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O let me walk with Thee, my God,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
As Enoch walked in days of old;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Place Thou my trembling hand in Thine,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And sweet communion with me hold;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
E’en though the path I may not see,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yet, Jesus, let me walk with Thee.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I cannot, dare not, walk alone;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The tempest rages in the sky,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
A thousand snares beset my feet,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
A thousand foes are lurking nigh.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Still Thou the raging of the sea,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
O Master! let me walk with Thee.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If I may rest my hand in Thine,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I’ll count the joys of earth but loss,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And firmly, bravely journey on;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I’ll bear the banner of the cross

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Till Zion’s glorious gates I see;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yet, Savior, let me walk with Thee.
