1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Christ is alive!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let Christians sing.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
His cross stands empty to the sky.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let streets and homes with praises ring.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
His love in death shall never die.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Christ is alive!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No longer bound

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To distant years in Palestine,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He comes to claim the here and now

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And conquer every place and time.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
In every insult,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
rift, and war

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Where color, scorn or wealth divide,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He suffers still, yet loves the more,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And lives, though ever crucified.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Christ is alive!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Ascended Lord

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He rules the world His Father made,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Till, in the end, His love adored

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Shall be to all on earth displayed.
