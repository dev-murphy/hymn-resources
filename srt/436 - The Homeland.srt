1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The homeland! O the homeland!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The land of the free born!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There’s no night in the homeland,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But aye the fadeless morn;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I’m sighing for homeland,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
My heart is aching here;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There is no pain in the homeland

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To which I’m drawing near;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There is no pain in the homeland

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To which I’m drawing near.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My Lord is in the homeland,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
With angels bright and fair;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There’s no sin in the homeland,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And no temptation there;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The music of the homeland

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Is ringing in my ears;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And when I think of the homeland

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
My eyes are filled with tears;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And when I think of the homeland

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
My ears are filled with tears.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The dwellers in the homeland

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Are beckoning me to come,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Where neither death nor sorrow

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Invades their holy name;

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
O dear, dear native country!

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
O rest and peace above!

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Christ bring us all to the homeland

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Of Thy redeeming love;

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Christ bring us all to the homeland

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Of Thy redeeming love
