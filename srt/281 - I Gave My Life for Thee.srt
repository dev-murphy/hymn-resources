1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I gave my life for thee,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
My precious blood I shed,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That thou might’st ransom be,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And quickened from the dead;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I gave, I gave My life for thee,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What hast thou given for Me?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I gave, I gave My life for thee,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What hast thou given for Me?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
My Fathers house of light,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My glory circled throne,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I left for earthly night,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
For wanderings sad and lone;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I left, I left it all for thee,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hast thou left aught for Me?

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I left, I left it all for thee,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Hast thou left aught for Me?

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I suffered much for thee,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
more than thy tongue can tell,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Of bitterest agony,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
To rescue thee from hell;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I’ve borne, I’ve borne it all for thee,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What hast thou borne for Me?

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I’ve borne, I’ve borne it all for thee,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What hast thou borne for Me?
