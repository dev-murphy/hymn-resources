1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Praise, my soul, the King of heaven;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To his feet thy tribute bring;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Who like thee His praise should sing?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Praise the everlasting King.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Praise him for his grace and favor

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To our fathers in distress;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Praise him still the same forever,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Slow to chide and swift to bless:

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Glorious in His faithfulness.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Tenderly He shields and spares us;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Well our feeble frame he knows;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In his hands He gently bears us,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Rescues us from all our foes.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Widely yet his mercy flows.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Angels, help us to adore him;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Ye behold him face to face;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Sun and moon, bow down before him,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Dwellers all in time and space.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Praise with us the God of grace.
