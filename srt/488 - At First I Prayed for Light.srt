1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
At first I prayed for light:

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Could I but see the way,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
How gladly, swiftly would I walk

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To everlasting day!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And next I prayed for strength:

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That I might tread the road

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
With firm, unfaltering feet, and win

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The heaven’s serene abode.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And then I asked for faith:

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Could I but trust my God,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I’d live infolded in His peace,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Though foes were all abroad.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But now I pray for love:

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Deep love to God and man;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
A living love that will not fail,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
However dark His plan.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And light and strength and faith

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Are opening everywhere!

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
God waited patiently until

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I prayed the larger prayer.
