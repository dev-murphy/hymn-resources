1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My faith has found a resting place,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Not in a manmade creed;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I trust the ever living One,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That He for me shall plead.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I need no other evidence,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I need no other plea;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It is enough that Jesus died,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And rose again for me.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Enough for me that Jesus saves,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This ends my fear and doubt;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
A sinful soul, I come to Him,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He will not cast me out.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
My soul is resting on the Word,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The living Word of God,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Salvation in my Savior’s name,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Salvation through His blood.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
My great Physician heals the sick,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The lost He came to save;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
For me His precious blood He shed,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
For me His life He gave.
