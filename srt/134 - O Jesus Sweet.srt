1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O Jesus sweet, O Jesus mild,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thy Father’s will hast Thou fulfilled;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For Thou hast left Thy heavenly throne

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Our lowly state to make Thine own.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O Jesus sweet, O Jesus mild.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
O Jesus sweet, O Jesus mild,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
With joy hast Thou the whole world filled;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thou comest down from heaven’s hall

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
To comfort us whom tears enthrall.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
O Jesus sweet, O Jesus mild.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
O Jesus sweet, O Jesus mild,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thou art love’s image undefiled.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Inflame our hearts with love’s pure fire,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That we may share Thy heart’s desire.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
O Jesus sweet, O Jesus mild.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
O Jesus sweet, O Jesus mild,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Help us to do as Thou hast willed.

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What’er we have belongs to Thee:

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
O may we ever faithful be.

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
O Jesus sweet, O Jesus mild.
