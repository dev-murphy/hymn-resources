1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
As with gladness men of old

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Did the guiding star behold,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
As with joy they hailed its light,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Leading onward, beaming bright,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So, most gracious Lord, may we

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Evermore be led to Thee.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
As with joyful steps they sped

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To that lowly manger bed,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There to bend the knee before

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Him whom heav’n and earth adore,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So may we with willing feet

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Ever seek Thy mercy seat.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
As they offered gifts most rare

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
At that manger rude and bare,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So may we with holy joy,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Pure, and free from sin’s alloy,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
All our costliest treasures bring,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Christ, to Thee our heav’nly King.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Holy Jesus, every day

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Keep us in the narrow way;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And, when earthly things are past,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Bring our ransomed souls at last

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Where they need no star to guide,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Where no clouds Thy glory hide.
