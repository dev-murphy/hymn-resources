1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus, your blood and righteousness

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
My beauty are, my glorious dress;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Mid flaming worlds, in these arrayed,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
With joy shall I lift up my head.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Bold shall I stand in that great day,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Cleansed and redeemed, no debt to pay;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For by your cross absolved I am

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
From sin and guilt, from fear and shame.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lord, I believe your precious blood,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Which at the mercy seat of God

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Pleads for the captives’ liberty,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Was also shed in love for me.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
When from the dust of death I rise

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To claim my mansion in the skies,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This then shall be my only plea:

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Christ Jesus lived and died for me.
