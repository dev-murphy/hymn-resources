1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lead on, O King eternal,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the day of march has come;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
henceforth in fields of conquest

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
thy tents shall be our home.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Through days of preparation

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
thy grace has made us strong;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and now, O King eternal,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
we lift our battle song.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lead on, O King eternal,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
till sin’s fierce war shall cease,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and holiness shall whisper

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the sweet amen of peace.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
For not with swords loud clashing,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
nor roll of stirring drums;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
with deeds of love and mercy

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
the heavenly kingdom comes.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Lead on, O King eternal,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
we follow, not with fears,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
for gladness breaks like morning

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
where’er thy face appears.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thy cross is lifted o’er us,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
we journey in its light;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
the crown awaits the conquest;

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
lead on, O God of might.
