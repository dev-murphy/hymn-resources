1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hark! the voice of Jesus calling,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
“Who will go and work today?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Fields are white, the harvest waiting,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Who will bear the sheaves away?”

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Loud and long the Master calleth,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Rich reward He offers free;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Who will answer, gladly saying,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
“Here am I, O Lord, send me”?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If you cannot cross the ocean

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And the heathen lands explore,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You can find the heathen nearer,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You can help them at your door;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If you cannot speak like angels,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you cannot preach like Paul,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You can tell the love of Jesus,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You can say He died for all.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If you cannot be the watchman,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Standing high on Zion’s wall,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Pointing out the path to heaven,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Offering life and peace to all;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
With your prayers and with your bounties

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You can do what Heaven demands,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You can be like faithful Aaron,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Holding up the prophet’s hands.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
While the souls of men are dying,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And the Master calls for you,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let none hear you idly saying,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
“There is nothing I can do!”

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Gladly take the task He gives you,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Let His work your pleasure be;

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Answer quickly when He calleth,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
“Here am I, O Lord, send me.”
