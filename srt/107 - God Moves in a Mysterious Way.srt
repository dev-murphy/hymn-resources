1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
God moves in a mysterious way

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
His wonders to perform;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He plants His footsteps in the sea,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And rides upon the storm.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The clouds ye so much dread

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Are big with mercy, and shall break

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In blessings on your head.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But trust Him for His grace;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Behind a frowning providence

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He hides a smiling face.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
His purposes will ripen fast,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Unfolding every hour;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The bud may have a bitter taste,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But sweet will be the flower.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Blind unbelief is sure to err,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And scan His work in vain;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
God is His own interpreter,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And He will make it plain.
