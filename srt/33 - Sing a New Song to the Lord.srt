1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Sing a new song to the Lord,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He to whom wonders belong.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Rejoice in His triumph and tell of His power.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
O sing a new song to the Lord.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now to the ends of the earth

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
See His salvation is shown.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And still He remembers His mercy and truth,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Unchanging in love to His own.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sing a new song and rejoice.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Publish His praises abroad.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let voices in chorus with trumpet and horn,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Resound for the joy of the Lord.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Join with the hills and the sea,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Thunders of praise to prolong.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In judgement and justice

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He comes to the earth

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O sing a new song to the Lord.
