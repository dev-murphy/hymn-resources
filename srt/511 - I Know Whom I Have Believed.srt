1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I know not why God’s wondrous grace To me He hath made known,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love Redeemed me for His own.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But “I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that His is able

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To keep that which I’ve committed Unto Him against that day.”

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I know not how this saving faith To me He did impart,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Nor how believing in His word Wrought peace within my heart.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I know not how the Spirit moves, Convincing men of sin,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Revealing Jesus through the word, Creating faith in Him.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I know not when my Lord may come, At night or noonday fair,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Nor if I walk the vale with Him, Or meet Him in the air.
