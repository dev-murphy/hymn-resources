1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You that know the Lord is gracious,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You for whom a cornerstone

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Stands, of God elect and precious,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Laid that you may build there-on,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
See that on that sure foundation

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You a living temple raise.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Towers that may tell forth salvation,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Walls that may reech-o praise.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Living stones by God appointed

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Each to his allotted place,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Kings and priests, by God anointed,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Shall you not declare His grace?

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You, a royal generation,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Tell the tidings of your birth,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Tidings of a new creation

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
To an old and weary earth.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Tell the praise of Him who called you

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Out of darkness into light,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Broke the fetters that enthralled you,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Gave you freedom, peace, and sight:

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Tell the tale of sins forgiven,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Strength renewed and hope restored,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Till the earth, in tune with heaven,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Praise and magnify the Lord.
