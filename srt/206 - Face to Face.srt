1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Face to face with Christ my Savior,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Face to face, what will it be,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When with rapture I behold Him,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Jesus Christ, who died for me?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Face to face shall I behold Him,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Far beyond the starry sky;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Face to face in all His glory

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I shall see Him by and by!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Only faintly now I see Him,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
With the darkening veil between,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But a blessed day is coming,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
When His glory shall be seen.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What rejoicing in His presence,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
When are banished grief and pain;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When the crooked ways are straightened,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And the dark things shall be plain!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Face to face! oh, blissful moment!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Face to face to see and know;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Face to face with my Redeemer,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Jesus Christ, who loves me so.
