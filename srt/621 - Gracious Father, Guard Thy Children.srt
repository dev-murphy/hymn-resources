1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Gracious Father, guard Thy children

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
From the foe’s destructive power;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Save, O save them, Lord, from falling

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In this dark and trying hour.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thou wilt surely prove Thy people,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
All our graces must be tried;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But Thy word illumes our pathway,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And in God we still confide.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We are in the time of waiting;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Soon we shall behold our Lord,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Wafted far away from sorrow,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To receive our rich reward.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Keep us, Lord, till Thine appearing,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Pure, unspotted from the world;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let Thy Holy Spirit cheer us

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Till Thy banner is unfurled.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
With what joyful exultation

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Shall the saints Thy banner see,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
When the Lord for whom we’ve waited

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Shall proclaim the jubilee!

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Freedom from this world’s pollutions;

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Freedom from all sin and pain;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Freedom from the wiles of Satan,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And from death’s destructive reign.
