1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Day of judgement, day of wonders!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hark the trumpet’s awful sound,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Louder than a thousand thunders,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Shakes the vast creation round!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
How the summons

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Will the sinner’s heart confound!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
See the Lord in the glory nearing,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Clothed in majesty divine,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You who long for His appearing,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Then shall say, “This God is mine!”

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Gracious Savior, Gracious Savior,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Own me in that day as Thine.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
At His call the dead awaken,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Rise to life form earth and sea!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All the powers of nature shaken

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
By His looks prepare to flee.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Careless sinner, Careless sinner,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What will then become of thee?

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But to those who have confessed

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Loved and served the Lord below,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He will say, “Come near, ye blessed,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
See the kingdom I bestow;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You forever, You forever

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Shall my love and glory know.”
