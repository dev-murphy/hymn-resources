1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Draw me, my Savior, so precious Thou art;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Fold me, O fold me close to Thy breast,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Shelter me safe in that haven of rest,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Shelter me safe in that haven of rest.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Nought as an offering to Jesus my King-

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Only my sinful now contrite heart,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be Thine;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Sin, with its follies, I gladly resign,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Till safe in glory my anchor is cast;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Through endless ages, ever to be,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee.
