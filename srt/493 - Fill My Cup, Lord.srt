1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Like the woman at the well I was seeking

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For things that could not satisfy:

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And then I heard my Savior speaking:

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
” Draw from my well that never shall run dry”.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Fill my cup Lord, I lift it up, Lord!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Bread of heaven, Feed me till I want no more–

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There are millions in this world who are craving

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The pleasures earthly things afford;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But none can match the wondrous treasure

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That I find in Jesus Christ my Lord.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So, my brother, if the things this world gave you

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Leave hungers that won’t pass away,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
My blessed Lord will come and save you,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If you kneel to Him and humbly pray:
