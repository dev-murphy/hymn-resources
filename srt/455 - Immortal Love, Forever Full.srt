1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Immortal Love, forever full,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Forever flowing free,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Forever shared, forever whole,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A never ebbing sea!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We nay not climb the heavenly steeps

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To bring the Lord Christ down;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
In vain we search the lowest deeps,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
For him no depths can drown.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But warm, so tender, even yet

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
A present help is He;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And faith has still its Olivet,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And love its Galilee.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The healing of His seamless dress

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Is by our beds of pain;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We touch Him in life’s throng and press,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And we are whole again.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Through Him the first fond prayers are said,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Our lips of childhood frame;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The last low whispers of our dead

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Are burdened with His name.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
O Lord and Master of us all:

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Whate’er our names or sign,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We test our lives by Thine!
