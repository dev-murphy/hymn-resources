1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The King shall come when morning dawns

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And light triumphant breaks,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When beauty gilds the eastern hills

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And life to joy awakes.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Not as of old a little child,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To bear and fight and die,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But crowned with glory like the sun

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That lights the morning sky.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O, brighter than that rising morn

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When Christ, victorious, rose

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And left the lonesome place death,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Despite the rage of foes.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O, brighter than that glorious morn

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Shall dawn upon our race

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
They day when Christ in splendour comes,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And we shall see His face.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The King shall come when morning dawns

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And light and beauty brings.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Hail, Christ the Lord! Your people pray:

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Come quickly, King of kings.
