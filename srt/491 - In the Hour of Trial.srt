1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the hour of trial, Jesus, plead for me,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Lest by base denial I depart from Thee;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When Thou see’st me waver, with a look recall,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Nor, for fear or favor, suffer me to fall.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
With forbidden pleasures would this vain world charm;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Or its sordid treasures spread to work me harm;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Bring to my remembrance sad Gethsemane,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Or, in darker semblance, cross-crowned Calvary.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Should Thy mercy send me sorrow, toil, and woe,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Or should pain attend me on my path below,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Grant that I may never fail Thy hand to see;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Grant that I may ever cast my care on Thee.
