1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I will sing of my Redeemer,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And His wondrous love to me;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
On the cruel cross He suffered,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
From the curse to set me free.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
With His blood, He purchased me.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
On the cross, He sealed my pardon,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Paid the debt, and made me free.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I will tell the wondrous story,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How my lost estate to save,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
In His boundless love and mercy,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He the ransom freely gave.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I will sing of my Redeemer,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And His heavenly love to me;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He from death to life hath brought me,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Son of God with Him to be.
