1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Christian, seek not yet repose, Cast thy dreams of ease away;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thou art in the midst of foes; Watch and pray!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Gird thy heavenly armor on, Wear it ever, night and day;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Ambushed lies the evil one; Watch and pray!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hear the victors who o’ercame; Still they mark each warrior’s way;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
All with one sweet voice exclaim: “Watch and pray!”

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Hear, above all, hear thy Lord, Him thou lovest to obey;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hide within thy heart His word; “Watch and pray!”

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Watch, as if on that alone Hung the issue of the day;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Pray that help may be sent down; Watch and pray!
