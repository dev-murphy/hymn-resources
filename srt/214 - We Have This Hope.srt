1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We have this hope that burns within our heart,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hope in the coming of the Lord.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000

We believe the time is here,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When the nations far and near

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Shall awake, and shout and sing

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hallelujah! Christ is King!

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Soon the heav’ns will open wide,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Christ will come to claim His bride,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
All the universe will sing

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hallelujah! Christ is King!

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
