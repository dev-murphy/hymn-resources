1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Thine is the glory,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Risen, conquering Son;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Endless is the victory thou o’er death hast won.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Kept the folded grave-clothes where Thy body lay.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thine is the glory,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Risen, conquering Son;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Endless is the victory Thou o’er death hast won.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lo! Jesus meets us.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Risen from the tomb,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Lovingly He greets us,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Scatters fear and gloom;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let His Church with gladness hymns of triumph sing,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
For her Lord now liveth;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Death has lost its sting.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No more we doubt Thee,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Glorious Prince of life!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Life is nought without Thee;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Aid us in our strife;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Make us more than conquerors through Thy deathless love

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Bring us safe through Jordan to Thy home above.
