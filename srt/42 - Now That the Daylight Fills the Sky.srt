1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now that the daylight fills the sky,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We lift our hearts to God on high,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That He, in all we do or say,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Would keep us free from harm today;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Would guard our hearts and tongues from strife;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
From anger’s din would shield our life;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
From evil sights would turn our eyes,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And close our ears to vanities;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So we, when this new day is gone

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And night in turn is drawing on,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
With conscience by the world unstained

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Shall praise His name for vict’ry gained.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
“All praise to You, creator Lord!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
All praise to You, eternal Word!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All praise to You, O Spirit wise!”

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We sing as daylight fills the skies.
