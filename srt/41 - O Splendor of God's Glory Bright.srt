1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O splendor of God’s glory bright,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
From light eternal bringing light;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
O Light of life, light’s living spring,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
True day, all days illumining.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O Thou true Sun, on us Thy glance

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let fall in royal radiance;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The Spirit’s sanctifying beam

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Upon our earthly senses stream.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O joyful be the passing day

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
With thoughts as clear as morning’s ray,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
With faith like noontide shining bright,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Our souls unshadowed by the night.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Dawn’s glory gilds the earth and skies;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let Him, our perfect morn, arise;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The Father’s help His children claim,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And sing the Father’s glorious name. Amen.
