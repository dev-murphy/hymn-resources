1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Together let us sweetly live,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Together love to Jesus give;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O Canaan, bright Canaan,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O Canaan, it is my happy home,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Together let us watch and pray;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And wait redemption’s joyous day;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Our songs of praise shall fill the skies;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
While higher still our joys shall rise;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Then come with me, beloved friend;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The joys to come shall never end;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I am bound for the land of Canaan.
