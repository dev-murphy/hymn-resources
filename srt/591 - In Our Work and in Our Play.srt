1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In our work and in our play,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Jesus, ever with us stay;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
May be always strive to be

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
True and faithful unto Thee.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Then we truthfully can sing,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We are children of the King.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
May we in Thy strength subdue

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Evil tempers, words untrue,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thoughts impure, and deeds unkind,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
All things hateful to Thy mind.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Then we truthfully can sing,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We are children of the King.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Children of the King are we!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
May we loyal to Him be;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Try to please Him every day,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
In our work and in our play.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Then we truthfully can sing,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We are children of the King.
