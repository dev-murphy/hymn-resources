00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Sweet promise is given to all who believe–

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
“Behold I come quickly, Mine own to receive;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hold fast till I come; the danger is great;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sleep not as do others; be watchful, and wait.”

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
“Hold fast till I come,” sweet promise of heaven–

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
“The kingdom restored, to you shall be given.”

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
“Come, enter My joy, sit down on the throne;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Bright crowns are in waiting; hold fast till I come.”

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We’ll “watch unto prayer” with lamps burning bright;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He comes to all others a “thief in the night.”

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We know He is near, but know not the day–

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
As spring shows that summer is not far away.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes! this is our hope, ’tis built on His word–

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The glorious appearing of Jesus, our Lord;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Of promises all, it stands as the sum:

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
“Behold I come quickly; hold fast till I come.”
