1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Abide with me, ’tis eventide!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The day is past and gone;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The shadows of the evening fall;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The night is coming on!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Within my heart a welcome guest,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Within my home abide;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O Savior, stay this night with me;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Behold, ’tis eventide!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O Savior, stay this night with me;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Behold, ’tis eventide.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Abide with me, ’tis eventide!

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thy walk today with me

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Has made my heart within me burn,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
As I communed with Thee.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thy earnest words have filled my soul

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And kept me near Thy side;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Abide with me, ’tis eventide!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And lone will be the night,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If I cannot commune with Thee,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Nor find in Thee my light.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The darkness of the world, I fear,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Would in my home abide;
