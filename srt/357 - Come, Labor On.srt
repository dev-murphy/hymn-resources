1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come, labor on.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Who dares stand idle on the harvest plain

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
While all around him waves the golden grain?

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And to each servant does the Master say,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
“Go work today.”

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Come, labor on.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Claim the high calling angels cannot share;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To young and old the gospel gladness bear;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Redeem the time; its hours too swiftly fly.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The night draws nigh.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Come, labor on.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
No time for rest; till glows the western sky,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Till the long shadows oér our pathway lie,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And a glad sound comes with the setting sun,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
“Well done, well done!”
