00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus, Son of blessed Mary,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Once on earth a little child,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Pattern fair of holy living,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Gracious, loving, undefiled;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Though Thy eager heart was yearning

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Heavy laden souls to free,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yet Thou calledst little children

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In their happiness to Thee.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Grant that we, like little children,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Free from pride and guile my be;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Cheerful, trusting, safe, protected

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
By the blessed Trinity.
