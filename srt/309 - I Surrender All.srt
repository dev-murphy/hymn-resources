1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
All to Jesus I surrender;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
all to him I freely give;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I will ever love and trust him,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
in his presence daily live.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I surrender all, I surrender all,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
all to thee, my blessed Savior,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I surrender all.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
All to Jesus I surrender;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
humbly at his feet I bow,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
worldly pleasures all forsaken;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
take me, Jesus, take me now.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All to Jesus I surrender;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
make me, Savior, wholly thine;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
fill me with thy love and power;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
truly know that thou art mine.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
All to Jesus I surrender;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
now I feel the sacred flame.

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
O the joy of full salvation!

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Glory, glory, to his name!
