1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus shall reign where’er the sun

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Does his successive journeys run;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
People and realms of ev’ry tongue

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Dwell on His love with sweetest song,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And infant voices shall proclaim

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Their early blessings on His name.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Blessings abound wherever He reigns;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The prisoner leaps to lose his chains;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The weary find eternal rest,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And all who suffer want are blessed.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let every creature rise and bring

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Honors peculiar to our King;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Angels descend with songs again,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And earth repeat the loud amen!
