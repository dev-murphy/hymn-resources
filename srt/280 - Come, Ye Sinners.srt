1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come, ye sinners poor and needy,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Weak and wounded, sick and sore;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Jesus ready stands to save you,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Full of pity, love, and power.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I will arise and go to Jesus,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He will embrace me in His arms;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
In the arms of my dear Savior,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O there are ten thousand charms.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Come. ye thirsty, come, and welcome,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
God’s free bounty glorify;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
True belief and true repentance,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Every grace that brings you nigh.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let not conscience make you linger,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Nor of fitness fondly dream;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All the fitness He requireth

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Is to feel your need of Him.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Lo! th’incarnate God, ascended,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Pleads the merit of His blood;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Venture on Him, venture wholly,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Let no other trust intrude.
