1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
By His presence all divine?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
True and tender, pure and precious,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, how blest to call Him mine!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
All that thrills my soul is Jesus;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He is more than life to me; (to me;)

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And the fairest of ten thousand,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In my blessed Lord I see.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Love of Christ so freely given,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Grace of God beyond degree,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Mercy higher than the heaven,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Deeper than the deepest sea.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Every need His hand supplying,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Every good in Him I see;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
On His strength divine relying,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He is All in All to me.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
By the crystal flowing river

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
With the ransomed I will sing,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And forever and forever

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Praise and glorify the King.
