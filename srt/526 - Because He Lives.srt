1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He came to love, heal, and forgive;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He lived and died to buy my pardon,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Because He lives I can face tomorrow,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Because He lives all fear is gone;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Because I know He holds the future.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And life is worth the living just because He lives.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How sweet to hold a newborn baby,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And feel the pride, and joy He gives;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But greater still the calm assurance,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This child can face uncertain days because He lives.
