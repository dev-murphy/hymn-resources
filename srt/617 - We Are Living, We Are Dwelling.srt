1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We are living, we are dwelling, In a grand and awful time,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In an age on ages telling– To be living is sublime.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hark! the waking up of nations, Gog and Magog to the fray;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hark! what soundeth? Is creation Groaning for her latter day?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Christian, rouse and arm for conflict, Nerve thee for the battlefield;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Bear the helmet of salvation, And the mighty gospel shield;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let the breastplate, peace, be on thee, Take the Spirit’s sword in hand;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Boldly, fearlessly, go forth then, In Jehovah’s strength to stand.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And the prince of evil spirits, Great deceiver of the world!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He who at the blessed Jesus Once his deadly weapons hurled,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Cometh with unwonted power, Knowing that his reign will cease

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
When the kingdom shall be given To the mighty Prince of Peace.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Christians, rouse! fight in this warfare, Cease not till the victory’s won;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Till your Captain loud proclaimeth, “Servant of the Lord, well done!”

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He, alone, who thus is faithful, Who abideth to the end,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Hath the promise, in the kingdom An eternity to spend.
