1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Bread of the world in mercy broken,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Wine of the soul in mercy shed,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
By whom the words of life are spoken,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And in whose death our sins are dead;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Look on the heart by sorrow broken,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Look on the tears by sinners shed;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And be Thy feast to us the token

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That by Thy grace our souls are fed. Amen.
