1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
God is my strong salvation,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What foe have I to fear?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In darkness and temptation,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
My Light, my Help, is near:

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Though hosts encamp around me,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Firm in the fight I stand;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What terror can confound me,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
With God at my right hand?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Place on the reliance;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My soul with courage wait;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
His truth be thine affiance,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
When faint and desolate.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
His might thy heart shall strengthen,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
His love thy joy increase;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Mercy thy days shall lengthen;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The Lord will give thee peace.
