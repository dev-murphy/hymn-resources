1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Father, who on us do shower

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Gifts of plenty form Your dower,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
To Your people give the power

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All Your gifts to use aright.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Give pure happiness in leisure

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Temperance in every pleasure,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Wholesome use of earthly treasure

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Bodies clean and spirits bright.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lift from this and every nation

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
All that brings us degradation;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Quell the forces of temptation;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Put Your enemies to flight.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Father, You who sought and found us,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Son of God, whose love has bound us,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Holy Spirit, in us, round us,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Hear us, Godhead infinite.
