1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Star of our hope! He’ll soon appear,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The last loud trumpet speaks Him near;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hail Him, all saints, from pole to pole-

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How welcome to the faithful soul!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
From heaven angelic voices sound:

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Behold the Lord of glory crowned,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Arrayed in majesty divine,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And in His highest glories shine.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The grave yields up its precious trust,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Which long has slumbered in the dust,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Resplendent forms ascending, fair,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Now meet the Savior in the air.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Descending with His azure throne,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He claims the kingdom for His own;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The saints rejoice, they shout, they sing,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And hail Him their triumphant King.
