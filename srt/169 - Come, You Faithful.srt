1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come, you faithful, raise the strain

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Of triumphant gladness;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
God has brought His people

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now rejoice, Jerusalem,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And with true affection

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Welcome in unwearied strains

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Jesus’resurrection.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
‘Tis the spring of souls today;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Christ has burst His prison

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
From the frost and gloom of death

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
light and life have risen

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All the winter of our sins,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Long and dark, is flying

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
From His ligth, to whom we give

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thanks and praise undying.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
“Alleluia!” now we cry

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
to our King immortal,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Who, triumphant, burst the

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
bars of the tomb’s dark portal

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
“Alleluia!” with the Son,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
God the Father praising;

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
“Alleluia!” yet again to

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
the Spirit raising.
