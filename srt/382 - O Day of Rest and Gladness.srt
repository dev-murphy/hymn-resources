1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O day of rest and gladness,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
O day of joy and light,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
O balm of care and sadness,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
most beautiful, most bright;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
on thee, the high and lowly,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
who bend before throne,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
sing, “Holy, holy, holy,”

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to the Eternal One.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thou art a port protected

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
from storms that round us rise;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
a garden intersected

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
with streams of paradise;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
thou art a cooling fountain

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
in life’s dry, dreary sand;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
from thee, like Pisgah’s mountain,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
we view our promised land.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
A day of sweet reflection,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
thou art a day of love,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
A day to raise affection

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
from earth to things above.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
New graces ever gaining

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
from this our day of rest,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We reach the rest remaining

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
in mansions of the blessed.
