00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I’d rather have Jesus than silver or gold;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I’d rather be His than have riches untold;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I’d rather have Jesus than houses or land;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I’d rather be led by His nail-pierced hand:

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He’s fairer than lilies of rarest bloom;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He’s sweeter than honey from out the comb;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He’s all that my hungering spirit needs –

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I’d rather have Jesus and let Him lead:
