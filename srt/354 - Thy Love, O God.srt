1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Thy love, O God, has all mankind created,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And led Thy people to this present hour;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In Christ we see life’s glory consummated;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thy Spirit manifests His living power.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
From out the darkness of our hope’s frustration,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
From all the broken idols of our pride,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We turn to seek Thy truth’s illumination,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And find Thy mercy waiting at our side.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
In pity look upon Thy children’s striving

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
For life and freedom, peace and brotherhood,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Till at the fullness of Thy truth arriving,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We find in Christ the crown of every good.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Inspire Thy church, mid earth’s discordant voices,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To preach the gospel of her Lord above,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Until the day this warring world rejoices

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
To hear the mighty harmonies of love.
