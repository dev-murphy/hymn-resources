1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The great Physician now is near,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The sympathizing Jesus;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh! hear the voice of Jesus.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sweetest note in seraph song,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Sweetest name on mortal tongue;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sweetest carol ever sung,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Jesus, blessed Jesus.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Your many sins are all forgiven,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh! hear the voice of Jesus;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Go on your way in peace to heaven,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And wear a crown with Jesus.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All glory to the dying Lamb!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I now believe in Jesus;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I love the blessed Savior’s name,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I love the name of Jesus.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
His name dispels my guilt and fear,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No other name but Jesus;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh! how my soul delights to hear

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The charming name of Jesus.
