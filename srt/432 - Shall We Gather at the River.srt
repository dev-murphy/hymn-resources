1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Shall we gather at the river,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
where bright angel feet have trod,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
with its crystal tide forever

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
flowing by the throne of God?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, we’ll gather at the river,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the beautiful, the beautiful river;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
gather with the saints at the river

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
that flows by the throne of God.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
On the margin of the river,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
washing up its silver spray,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
we will walk and worship ever,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
all the happy golden day.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Ere we reach the shining river,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
lay we every burden down;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
grace our spirits will deliver,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and provide a robe and crown.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Soon we’ll reach the shining river,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
soon our pilgrimage will cease;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
soon our happy hearts will quiver

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
with the melody of peace.
