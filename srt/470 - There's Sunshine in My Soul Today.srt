1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There’s sunshine in my soul today,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
More glorious and bright

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Than glows in any earthly sky,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For Jesus is my light.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O there’s sunshine, blessed sunshine,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When the peaceful, happy moments roll

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When Jesus shows His smiling face

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There is sunshine in the soul.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There’s music in my soul today,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
A carol to my King,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And Jesus, listening, can hear

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The songs I cannot sing.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There’s springtime in my soul today,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
For when the Lord is near,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The dove of peace sings in my heart,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The flowers of grace appear.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Theres gladness in my soul today,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And hope, and praise, and love,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
For blessings which He gives me now,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
For joys “laid up” above.
