1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
All people that on earth do dwell,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Him serve with mirth, his praise forth tell;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
come ye before him and rejoice.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Know that the Lord is God indeed;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
without our aid he did us make;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
we are his folk, he doth us feed,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and for his sheep he doth us take.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O enter then his gates with praise;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
approach with joy his courts unto;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
praise, laud, and bless his name always,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
for it is seemly so to do.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
For why! the Lord our God is good;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
his mercy is forever sure;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
his truth at all times firmly stood,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and shall from age to age endure.
