1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now thank we all our God

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
with heart and hands and voices,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
who wondrous things hath done,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
in whom His world rejoices;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Who, from our mothers’ arms

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
hath blessed us on our way

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
with countless gifts of love,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and still is ours today.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O may this bounteous God

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
through all our life be near us,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
with ever joyful hearts

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and blessed peace to cheer us;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and keep us still in grace,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and guide us when perplexed;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and free us from all ills,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
in this world and the next.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
All praise and thanks to God

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
the Father now be given;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
the Son, and Him who reigns

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
with them in highest heaven;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
the one eternal God,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
whom earth and heaven adore;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
for thus it was, is now,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and shall be evermore.
