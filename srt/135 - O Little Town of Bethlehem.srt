1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting Light;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
While mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wondering love.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O morning stars together, proclaim the holy birth,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And praises sing to God the King, and peace to men on earth!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How silently, how silently, the wondrous Gift is giv’n;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of His heav’n.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No ear may hear His coming, but in this world of sin,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Where meek souls will receive Him still, the dear Christ enters in.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O holy Child of Bethlehem, descend to us, we pray;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Cast out our sin, and enter in, be born in us today.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We hear the Christmas angels the great glad tidings tell;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
O come to us, abide with us, our Lord Emmanuel!
