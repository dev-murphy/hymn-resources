1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Just as I am, Thine own to be,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Friend of the young, who lovest me,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
To consecrate myself to Thee,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
O Jesus Christ, I come.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In the glad morning of my day,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
My life to give, my vows to pay,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
With no reserve and no delay,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
With all my heart I come.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I would live ever in the light,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I would work ever for the right;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I would serve Thee with all my might;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Therefore, to Thee I come.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Just as I am, young, strong, and free,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To be the best that I can be

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
For truth, and righteousness, and Thee,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Lord of my life, I come.
