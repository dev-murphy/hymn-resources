00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus, Thou joy of loving hearts!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thou fount of life! Thou light of men!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
From the best bliss that earth imparts,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We turn unfilled to Thee again.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thy truth unchanged has ever stood;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thou savest those that on Thee call;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
To them that seek Thee Thou art good,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To them that find Thee, all in all.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We taste Thee, O Thou living Bread,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And long to feast upon Thee still;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We drink of Thee, the Fountainhead,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And thirst our souls from Thee to fill!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Our restless spirits yearn for Thee,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Where-e’r our changeful lot is cast;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Glad, when Thy gracious smile we see,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Blest, when our faith can hold Thee fast.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O Jesus, ever with us stay;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Make all our moments calm and bright;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Chase the dark night of sin away,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Shed o’r the world Thy holy light!
