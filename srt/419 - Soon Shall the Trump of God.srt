1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Soon shall the trump of God

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Give out the welcome sound,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That shakes death’s silent chamber walls,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And breaks the turf sealed ground.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You dwellers in the dust,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Awake, come forth, and sing;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sharp has your frost of winter been,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But bright shall be your spring.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
‘Twas sown in weakness here;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
‘Twill then be raised in power;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That which was sown in earthly seed

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Shall rise a heav’nly flower.
