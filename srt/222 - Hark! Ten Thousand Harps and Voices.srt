1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hark! ten thousand harps and voices

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Sound the note of praise above;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Jesuse reigns, and heaven rejoices,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Jesus reigns, the God of love:

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
See, He sits on yonder throne;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Jesus rules the world alone.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Alleluia! Alleluia!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Alleluia! Amen.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
King of glory, reign forever,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thine an everlasting crown;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Nothing from Thy love shall sever

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Those whom Thou hast made Thine own;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Happy objects of Thy grace,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Destined to behold Thy face.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Alleluia! Alleluia!

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Alleluia! Amen.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Savior, hasten Thine appearing;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Bring, O bring the glorious day,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
When, the awful summons hearing,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Heaven and earth shall pass away:;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Then, with golden harps we’ll sing,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
“Glory, glory to our King!”

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Alleluia! Alleluia!

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Alleluia! Amen.
