1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Go, tell it on the mountain,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Over the hills and everywhere:

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Go, tell it on the mountain

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That Jesus Christ is born!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
While shepherds kept their watching

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
O’er silent flocks by night,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Behold throughout the heavens

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There shone a holy light.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The shepherds feared and trembled

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When lo! Above the earth

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Rang out the angel chorus

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That hailed our Savior’s birth.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Down in a lowly manger

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The humble Christ was born,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And brought us God’s salvation

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That blessed Christmas morn.
