1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We know not the hour of the Master’s appearing;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yet signs all foretell that the moment is nearing

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When He shall return ’tis the promise most cheering

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But we know not the hour.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He will come, let us watch and be ready;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He will come, hallelujah! hallelujah!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He will come in the clouds of His Father’s

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
bright glory but we know not the hour.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There’s light for the wise who are seeking salvation;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There’s truth in the book of the Lord’s revelation;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Each prophecy points to the great consummation

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But we know not the hour.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We’ll watch and we’ll pray, with our lamps trimmed and burning;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We’ll work and we’ll wait till the Master’s returning;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We’ll sing and rejoice, every omen discerning

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But we know not the hour.
