1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That was slain.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Glory, hallelujah!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Praise Him, hallelujah!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Glory, hallelujah!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To the Lamb!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Savior, let Thy kingdom come!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now the power of sin consume;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Bring Thy blest millennium,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Holy Lamb.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thus may we

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
each moment feel,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Love Him, serve Him,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
praise Him still,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Till we all on Zion’s hill

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
See the Lamb.
