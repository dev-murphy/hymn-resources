1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lift Him up, ’tis He that bids you,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let the dying look and live;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
To all weary, thirsting sinners,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Living waters will He give;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And though once so meek and lowly,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yet the Prince of heaven was He;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And the blind, who grope in darkness,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Through the blood of Christ shall see.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lift Him up, the risen Savior,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
High amid the waiting throng;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Lift Him up, ’tis He that speaketh,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Now He bids you flee from wrong.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Lift Him up, this precious Savior,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the multitude behold;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
They with willing hearts shall seek Him,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He will draw them to His fold;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
They shall gather from the wayside,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hastening on with joyous feet,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
They shall bear the cross of Jesus,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And shall find salvation sweet.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Lift Him up in all His glory,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
‘Tis the Son of God on high;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Lift Him up, His love shall draw them,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Eén the careless shall draw nigh;

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let them hear again the story

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Of the cross, the death of shame;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And from tongue to tongue repeat it;

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Mighty throngs shall bless His name.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
O then lift Him up in singing,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Lift the Savior up in prayer;

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
He, the glorious Redeemer,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
All the sins of men did bear;

33
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes, the young shall bow before Him,

34
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And the old their voices raise;

35
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:45,000
All the deaf shall hear hosannah;

36
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And the dumb shall shout His praise.
