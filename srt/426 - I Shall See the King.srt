1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I shall see the King where the angels sing,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I shall see the King some day, in the better land,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
On that golden strand,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And with Him shall ever stay.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In His glory, I shall see the King,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And forever endless praises sing;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
‘Twas on Calvary Jesus died for me;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I shall see the King someday.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
In the land of song, in the glory throng,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Where there never comes a night,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
With my Lord once slain I shall ever reign

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In the glory land of light.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I shall see the King, all my tributes bring,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And shall look upon His face;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then my song shall be how He ransomed me

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And has kept me by His grace.
