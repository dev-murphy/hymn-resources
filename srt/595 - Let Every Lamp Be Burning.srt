1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let every lamp be burning bright,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The darkest hour is nearing;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The darkest hour of earth’s long night,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Before the Lord’s appearing.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Then trim your lamps, my brethren dear,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Then trim your lamps with godly fear;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The Master’s coming draweth near,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let every lamp be burning.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Though thousands calmly slumber on,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The last great message spurning,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We’ll rest our living faith upon

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
His promise of returning.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
His word our lamp, His truth our guide,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We cannot be mistaken;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Though dangers rise on every side,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We shall not be forsaken.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Then let good works with faith appear,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
To help the world around us;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Obedience bring the blessing near

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
When faith has firmly bound us.
