1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come, ye disconsolate, where’er ye languish.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
come to the mercy seat, fervently kneel.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Joy of the desolate, light of the straying,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
“Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure.”

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Here see the bread of life; waters flowing

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
forth from the throne of God, pure from above.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
earth has no sorrow but heaven can remove.
