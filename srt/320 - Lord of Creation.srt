1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord of creation, to you be all praise!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Most mighty your working, most wondrous your ways!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Your glory and might are beyond us to tell,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And yet in the heart of the humble you dwell.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Lord of all power, I give you my will,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In joyful obedience your tasks to fulfill.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Your bondage is freedom; your service is song;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And held in your keeping, my weakness is strong.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lord of all wisdom, I give you my mind,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Rich truth that surpasses man’s knowledge to find;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What eye has not seen and what ear has not heard

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Is taught by your spirit and shines from your word.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Lord of all being, I give you my all,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If I ever disown you, I stumble and fall;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But led in your service your word to obey,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I’ll walk in your freedom to the end of the way.
