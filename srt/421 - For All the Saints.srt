1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
For all the saints

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
who from their labors rest,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Who thee by faith

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
before the world confessed.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thy name, O Jesus,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
be forever blest.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Alleluia!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Alleluia!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thou wast their Rock,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
their Fortress and their Might;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thou, Lord, their captain

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
in the well-fought fight;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thou, in the darkness drear,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
their one true light.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Alleluia!

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Alleluia!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O may Thy soldiers,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
faithful, true, and bold,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Fight as the saints

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
who nobly fought of old,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And win with them

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
the victor’s crown of gold.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Alleluia!

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Alleluia!

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And when the strife is fierce,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
the warfare long,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Steals on the ear

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
the distant triumph song,

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And hearts are brave again,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and arms are strong.

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Alleluia!

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Alleluia!

33
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:15,000
From earth’s wide bounds,

34
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:30,000
from ocean’s farthest coast,

35
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Thro’ gates of pearl

36
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:00,000
streams in the countless host,

37
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Singing to Father,

38
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Son, and Holy Ghost,

39
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Alleluia!

40
00:09:45,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Alleluia!
