00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord of all good, our gifts we bring You now;

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Use them Your holy purpose to fulfill.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Tokens of love and pledges they shall be

00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That our whole life is offered to Your will.

Hands, voices, eyes to serve Your great design;

Hearts with the flame of your own love ablaze:

00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thus for Your glory all our pow’rs combine.

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Christ, by whose willing sacrifice we live;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Spirit, from whom all life in fullness flows:

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To You with grateful hearts ourselves we give.
