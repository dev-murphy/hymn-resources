1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
with the cross of Jesus going on before.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Christ, the royal Master, leads against the foe;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
forward into battle see his banners go!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
with the cross of Jesus going on before.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like a mighty army moves the church of God;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
brothers, we are treading where the saints have trod.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We are not divided, all one body we,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
one in hope and doctrine, one in charity.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Crowns and thrones my perish, kingdoms rise and wane,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
but the church of Jesus constant will remain.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Gates of hell can never ‘gainst that church prevail;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
we have Christ’s own promise, and that cannot fail.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Onward then, ye people, join our happy throng,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
blend with ours your voices in the triumph song.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Glory, laud, and honor unto Christ the King,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
this through countless ages men and angels sing.
