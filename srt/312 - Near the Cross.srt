1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus, keep me near the cross;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
there a precious fountain,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
free to all, a healing stream,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
flows from Calvary’s mountain.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In the cross, in the cross,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
be my glory ever,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
till my raptured soul shall find

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
rest beyond the river.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Near the cross, a trembling soul,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
love and mercy found me;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
there the bright and morning star

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
sheds its beams around me.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Near the cross! O Lamb of God,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
bring its scenes before me;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
help me walk from day to day

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
with its shadow o’er me.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Near the cross I’ll watch and wait,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
hoping, trusting ever,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
till I reach the golden strand
