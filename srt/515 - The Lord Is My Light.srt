1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The Lord is my light; then why should I fear?

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
By day and by night His presence is near;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He is my salvation from sorrow and sin;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This blessed persuasion the Spirit brings in.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
By day and by night He leads me along;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
By day and by night He leads me along.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The Lord is my light; though clouds may arise,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Faith, stronger than sight, looks up to the skies

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Where Jesus forever in glory doth reign:

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Then how can I ever in darkness remain?

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The Lord is my light, the Lord is my strength;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I know in His might I’ll conquer at length;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
My weakness in mercy He covers with power,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And, walking by faith, He upholds me each hour.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The lord is my light, my all and in all;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
There is in His sight no darkness at all;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He is my Redeemer, my Savior and King;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
With saints and with angels His praises I sing.
