Come, holy Comforter,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thy sacred witness bear,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In this glad hour:

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Thou who almighty art,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Now rule in every heart,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And ne’er from us depart,

Thy sovereign majesty

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
May we in glory see,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And to eternity

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
