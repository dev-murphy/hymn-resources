1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Holy Spirit, gracious guest,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hear and grant our heart’s request

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For that gift supreme and best:

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Holy heav’nly love.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Faith that mountains could remove,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Tongues of earth or heaven above,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Knowledge, all things, empty prove

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If I have no love.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Though I as a martyr bleed,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Give my goods the poor to feed,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All is vain if love I need:

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Therefore give me love.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Love is kind and suffers long,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Love is pure and thinks no wrong,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Love than death it self more strong:

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Therefore give us love.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Prophecy will fade away,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Melting in the light of day;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Love will ever with us stay:

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Therefore give us love.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Faith and hope and love we see

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Joining hand in hand agree-

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But the greatest of the three,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And the best is love.
