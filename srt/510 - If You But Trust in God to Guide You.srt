1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If you but trust in God to guide you

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And place your confidence in Him,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You’ll find Him always there beside you,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To give you hope and strength within.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
For those who trust God’s changeless love

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Build on the rock that will not move.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What gain is there in futile weeping,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In helpless anger and distress?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If you are in His care and keeping,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In sorrow will He love you less?

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
For He who took for you a cross

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Will bring you safe through every loss.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In patient trust await His leisure

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In cheerful hope, with heart content

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To take whate’er your Father’s pleasure

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And all discerning love have sent;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Doubt not your inmost wants are known

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
To Him who chose you for His own.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Sing, pray, and keep His ways unswerving,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Offer your service faithfully,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And trust His word; though undeserving,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You’ll find His promise true to be.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
God never will forsake in need

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The soul that trusts in Him indeed.
