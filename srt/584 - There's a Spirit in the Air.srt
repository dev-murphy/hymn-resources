1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There’s a Spirit in the air, telling Christians everywhere

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
“Praise the love that Christ revealed, living, working in our world.”

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Lose your shyness, find your tongue; tell the world what God has done:

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
God in Christ has come to stay, we can see His pow’r today.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
When believers break the bread, when a hungry child is fed:

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Praise the love that Christ revealed, living, working in our world.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Still His Spirit leads the fight, seeing wrong and setting right:

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
God in Christ has come to stay, we can see His pow’r today.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
When a stranger’s not alone, where the homeless find a home,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Praise the love that Christ revealed, living, working in our world.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
May His Spirit fill our praise, guide our thoughts and change our ways.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
God in Christ has come to stay, we can see His power today.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There’s a Spirit in the air, calling people everywhere;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Praise the love that Christ revealed: living, working in our world.
