1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Rejoice ye pure in heart!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Rejoice, give thanks, and sing;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Your festal banner wave on high,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The cross of Christ your King.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Give thanks and sing.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
With voice as full and strong

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
As ocean’s surging praise,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Send forth the sturdy hymns of old,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The psalms of ancient days.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
With all the angel choirs,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
With all the saints of earth,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Pour out the strains of joy and bliss,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
True rapture, noblest mirth.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes, on through life’s long path,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Still chanting as ye go;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
From youth to age, by night and day,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In gladness and in woe.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Praise Him who reigns on high,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The Lord whom we adore,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The Father, Son and Holy Ghost,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
One God forever more.
