1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Though I speak with tongues of men and angels,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Though I have the prophet’s gift,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Though I hold the keys to hidden knowledge,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Though my faith can mountains shift;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Without love I am no better,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Without love it’s all for naught;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Lord, You spent Your life in loving others:

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What this means I would be taught.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Love is patient, knows no envy,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Never gloats when others sin;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Love is never glad to see injustice,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Always wants the truth to win.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There’s no end to love’s endurance,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There’s no test it cannot face;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Lord, You spent Your life in loving others:

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I shall fail without Your grace.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Though there’ll be an end to hidden knowledge,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Visions, raptures, prophecy:

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Faith and hope and love shall last forever,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Love the greatest of the three.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Without love I am no better,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Without love it’s all for naught;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Lord, You gave Your life in saving others:

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What this means I would be taught.
