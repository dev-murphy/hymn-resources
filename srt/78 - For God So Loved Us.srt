1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
For God so loved us,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He sent the Savior:

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For God so loved us,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and loves me too.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Love so unending!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I’ll sing His praises,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
God loves His children,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
loves even me.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He sent the Savior,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the blest Redeemer;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He sent the Savior

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to set me free.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He bade me welcome,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
O word of mercy;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He bade me welcome,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
O voice divine.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Glory and honor,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
O Love eternal,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
To Him be given

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
while life shall last.
