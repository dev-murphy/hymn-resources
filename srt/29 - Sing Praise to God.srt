1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Sing praise to God who reigns above,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the God of all creation,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the God of power, the God of love,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the God of our salvation.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
With healing balm my soul He fills,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and every faithless murmur stills;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
To God all praise and glory!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What God’s almighty power hath made

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
His gracious mercy keepeth;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
By morning glow or evening shade,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
His watchful eye ne’er sleepeth,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Within the kingdom of his might,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Lo! all is just, and all is right:

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To God all praise and glory!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The Lord is never far away,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
throughout all grief distressing,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
an ever present help and stay,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
our peace and joy and blessing.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
As with a mother’s tender hand,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He leads His own, His chosen band:

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
To God all praise and glory!

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Then all my gladsome way along,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I sing aloud thy praises,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
that men may hear the grateful song

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
my voice unwearied raises:

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Be joyful in the Lord, my heart!

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
both soul and body bear your part!

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
To God all praise and glory.
