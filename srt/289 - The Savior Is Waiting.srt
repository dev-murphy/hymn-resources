1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The Savior is waiting to enter your heart

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Why don’t you let Him come in?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There’s nothing in this world to keep you apart

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What is your answer to Him?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Time after time

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He has waited before

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And now He is waiting again

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To see if you are willing

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
To open the door

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, how He wants to come in.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If you’ll take one step

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Toward the Savior, my friend,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You’ll find His arms open wide.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Receive Him, and all of your darkness will end

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Within your heart He’ll abide.
