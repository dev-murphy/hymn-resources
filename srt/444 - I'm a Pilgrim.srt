1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I知 a pilgrim, and I知 a stranger;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I can tarry, I can tarry but a night;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Do not detain me, for I am going

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To where the fountains are ever flowing.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I知 a pilgrim, and I知 a stranger;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I can tarry, I can tarry but a night.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There the glory is ever shining!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O, my longing heart, my longing heart is there;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Here in this country so dark and dreary,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I long have wandered forlorn and weary.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There痴 the city to which I journey;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
My Redeemer, my Redeemer is its light!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There is no sorrow, nor any sighing,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Nor any tears there, or any dying.
