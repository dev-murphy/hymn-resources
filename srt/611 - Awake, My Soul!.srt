1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Awake, my soul! stretch every nerve,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And press with vigor on;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
A heavenly race demands thy zeal,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And an immortal crown.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
’Tis God’s all animating voice

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That calls thee from on high;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
’Tis He whose hand presents the prize

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To thine aspiring eye.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
A cloud of witnesses around

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hold thee in full survey;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Forget the steps already trod,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And onward urge thy way.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Blest Savior, introduced by Thee,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Our race have we begun;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And, crowned with victory, at Thy feet

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We’ll lay our trophies down.
