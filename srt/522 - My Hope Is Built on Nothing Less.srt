1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My hope is built on nothing less

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
than Jesus’ blood and righteousness.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but wholly lean on Jesus’ name.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
On Christ the solid rock I stand;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
all other ground is sinking sand,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
all other ground is sinking sand.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
When Darkness seems to veil His face,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I rest on his unchanging grace.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
in every high and stormy gale,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
my anchor holds within the veil.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
His oath, his covenant, his blood

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
supports me in the whelming flood.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
When all around my soul gives way,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
he then is all my hope and stay.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
When He shall come with trumpet sound,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O may I then in him be found!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Dressed in his righteousness alone,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
faultless to stand before the throne.
