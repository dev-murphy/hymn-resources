1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the morning, when I rise

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In the morning, when I rise

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In the morning, when I rise

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Give me Jesus.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Give me Jesus,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Give me Jesus.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You can have all this world,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Just give me Jesus.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Dark mid-night was my cry,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Dark mid-night was my cry,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Dark midnight was my cry,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Give me Jesus.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Just about the break of day,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Just about the break of day,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Just about the break of day,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Give me Jesus.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, when I come to die,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, when I come to die,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, when I come to die,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Give me Jesus.
