1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O happy band of pilgrims,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If onward ye will tread

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
With Jesus as your fellow,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To Jesus as your Head!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O happy if ye labor

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
As Jesus did for men;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O happy if ye hunger

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
As Jesus hungered then!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The trials that beset you,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The sorrows ye endure,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The manifold temptations

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That death alone can cure,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What are they but His jewels

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Of right celestial worth?

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What are they but the ladder

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Set up to heaven on earth?

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O happy band of pilgrims,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Look upward to the skies,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Where such a light affliction

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Shall win you such a prize!
