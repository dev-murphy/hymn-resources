1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus loves me! this I know,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For the Bible tells me so;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Little ones to Him belong

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
They are weak but He is strong

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, Jesus loves me!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, Jesus loves me!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes, Jesus loves me!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The Bible tells me so.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Jesus loves me! He who died

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Heaven’s gate to open wide:

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He will wash away my sin,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let His little child come in.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Jesus, take this heart of mine,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Make it pure and wholly thine;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
On the cross You died for me,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I will love and live for Thee.
