1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that calls me from a world of care,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and bids me at my Father’s throne

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
make all my wants and wishes known.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In seasons of distress and grief,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
my soul has often found relief,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and oft escaped the tempter’s snare

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
by thy return, sweet hour of prayer!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
thy wings shall my petition bear

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
to him whose truth and faithfulness

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
engage the waiting soul to bless.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And since he bids me seek his face,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
believe his word, and trust his grace,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I’ll cast on him my every care,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
May I thy consolation share

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Till from Mount Pisgah’s lofty height

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I view my home and take my flight.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
In my immortal flesh I’ll rise

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
To seize the everlasting prize.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And shout while passing through the air,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
“Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!”
