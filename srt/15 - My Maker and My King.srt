1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My Maker and my King,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To Thee my all I owe;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Thy sovereign bounty is the spring

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Whence all my blessings flow;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thy sovereign bounty is the spring

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Whence all my blessings flow.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The creature of Thy hand,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
On Thee alone I live;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
My God, Thy benefits demand

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
More praise than I can give.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My God, Thy benefits demand

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
More praise than I can give.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Lord, what can I impart

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
When all is Thine before?

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thy love demands a thankful heart;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The gift, alas! how poor.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thy love demands a thankful heart;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The gift, alas! how poor.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
O! let Thy grace inspire

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
My soul with strength divine;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let every word and each desire

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And all my days be Thine.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let every word and each desire

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And all my days be Thine.
