1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Give me the Bible,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
star of gladness gleaming,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
To cheer the wanderer

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
lone and tempest tossed,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No storm can hide that

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
peaceful radiance beaming

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Since Jesus came

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to seek and save the lost.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Give me the Bible–

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
holy message shining,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thy light shall guide me

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
in the narrow way.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Precept and promise,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
law and love combining,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
‘Til night shall vanish

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
in eternal day.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Give me the Bible

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
when my heart is broken,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
When sin and grief have

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
filled my soul with fear,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Give me the precious

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
words by Jesus spoken,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Hold up faith’s lamp

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
to show my Savior near.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Give me the Bible,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
all my steps enlighten,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Teach me the danger

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
of these realms below,

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That lamp of safety,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
o’er the gloom shall brighten,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That light alone

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
the path of peace can show.
