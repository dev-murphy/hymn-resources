1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Is this a day of new beginnings,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Time to remember and move on,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Time too believe what love is bringing,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Laying to rest the pain that’s gone?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
How can the seasons of a planet

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Mindlessly spinning round its sun

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
With just a human name and number

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Say that some new thing has begun?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yet through the life and death of Jesus

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Love’s mighty Spirit, now as then,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Can make for us a world of difference

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
As faith and hope are born again.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Then let us, with the Spirit’s daring,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Step from the past and leave behind

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Its disappointment, guilt, and grieving,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Seeking new paths, and sure to find.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Christ is alive, and goes before us

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
To show and share what love can do.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is a day of new beginnings;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Our God is making all things new.
