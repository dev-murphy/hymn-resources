1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He loved me ere I knew Him;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He drew me with the cords of love,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And thus He bound me to Him.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And ’round my heart still closely twine

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Those ties which nought can sever,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For I am His, and He is mine,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Forever and forever.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He bled, He died to save me;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And not alone the gift of life,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But His own self He gave me.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Nought that I have my own I call,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I hold it for the Giver;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
My heart, my strength, my life my all,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Are His, and His forever.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
All power to Him is given;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
To guard me on my upward course,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And bring me safe to heaven.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The eternal glories gleam afar,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
To nerve my faint endeavor;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So now to watch, to work, to war,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And then to rest forever.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So kind, and true, and tender,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So wise a counselor and guide,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So mighty a defender.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
From Him, who loveth me so well,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What power my soul can sever?

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Shall life or death, or earth, or hell?

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No; I am His forever.
