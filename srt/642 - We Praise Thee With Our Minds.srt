1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We praise Thee with our minds,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
O Lord

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Kept sharp think Thy thought;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Come,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Holy Ghost with grace outpoured,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To teach what Christ hath taught.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That wisdom from above

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Which comes to all: the brave,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
the meek

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who ask in faith and love.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We praise Thee thro’ our bodies,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Lord,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Kept strong to do Thy will;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
A means to praise Thee still.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We give ourselves, a sacrifice,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
To live as unto Thee;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
For Thou alone hast paid the price

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
To bring salvation free.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We praise Thee in our hearts,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
O king,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Kept pure to know Thy ways;

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And raise to Thee a hymn to sing

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Altho adoring hearts will bow

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We praise Thee in our beings now,

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Mind, body, heart, and soul.
