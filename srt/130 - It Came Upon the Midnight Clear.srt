1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It came upon the midnight clear,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That glorious song of old,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
From angels bending near the earth,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To touch their harps of gold:

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
“Peace on the earth, goodwill to men

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
From heavens all gracious King!”

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The world in solemn stillness lay

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To hear the angels sing.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Still through the cloven skies they come,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
With peaceful wings unfurled;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And still their heavenly music floats

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
O’er all the weary world:

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Above its sad and lowly plains

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
They bend on hovering wing,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And ever o’er its Babel sounds

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The blessed angels sing.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O ye beneath life’s crushing load,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Whose forms are bending low,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Who toil along the climbing way

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
With painful steps and slow;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Look now, for glad and golden hours

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Come swiftly on the wing;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Oh rest beside the weary road

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And hear the angels sing.
