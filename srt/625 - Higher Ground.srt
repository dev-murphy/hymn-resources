1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I’m pressing on the upward way,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
New heights I’m gaining every day;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Still praying as I’m onward bound,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
“Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.”

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
By faith, on Heaven’s table land,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
A higher plane than I have found;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
My heart has no desire to stay

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Though some may dwell where those abound,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I want to live above the world,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Though Satan’s darts at me are hurled;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
For faith has caught the joyful sound,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The song of saints on higher ground.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I want to scale the utmost height

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And catch a gleam of glory bright;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But still I’ll pray till Heav’n I’ve found,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
“Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.”
