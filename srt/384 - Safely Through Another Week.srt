1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Safely through another week

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
God has brought us on our way;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let us now a blessing seek,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Waiting in His courts today;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Day of all the week the best,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Emblem of eternal rest:

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Day of all the week the best,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Emblem of eternal rest.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
While we seek supplies of grace,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thro’ the dear Redeemer’s name,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Show Thy reconciling face;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Take away the sin and shame:

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
From our worldly cares set free,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
May we rest this day in Thee:

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
From our worldly cares set free,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
May we rest this day in Thee.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
When the more shall bid us rise,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
May we feel Thy presence near;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
May Thy glory meet our eyes,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
While we in Thy house appear:

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Here afford us, Lord, a taste

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Of our everlasting feast:

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Here afford us, Lord, a taste

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Of our everlasting feast.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
May the gospel’s joyful sound

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Conquer sinners, comfort saints;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Make the fruits of grace abound,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Bring relief to all complaints:

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Thus may all our Sabbaths be,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Till we we rise to reign with Thee.

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Thus may all our Sabbaths be,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Till we we rise to reign with Thee.
