1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Christ has for sin atonement made,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What a wonderful Saviour!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We are redeemed! the price is paid!

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What a wonderful Savior!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What a wonderful Savior

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
is Jesus, my Jesus!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What a wonderful Savior

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
is Jesus, my Lord!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I praise Him for the cleansing blood,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What a wonderful Saviour!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That reconciled my soul to God;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What a wonderful Saviour!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He walks beside me all the way,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What a wonderful Saviour!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And keeps me faithful day by day;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What a wonderful Saviour!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He gives me overcoming power,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What a wonderful Saviour!

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And triumph in each trying hour;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What a wonderful Saviour!
