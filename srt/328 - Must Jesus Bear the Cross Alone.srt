1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Must Jesus bear the cross alone,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and all the world go free?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
No, there’s a cross for everyone,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and there’s a cross for me.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The consecrated cross I’ll bear

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
till He shall set me free;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and then go home my crown to wear,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
for there’s a crown for me.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Upon the crystal pavement, down

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
at Jesus’ pierced feet,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
with joy I’ll cast my golden crown,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and His dear name repeat.
