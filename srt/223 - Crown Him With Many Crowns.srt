1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Crown him with many crowns,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the Lamb upon his throne,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
all music but its own.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Awake, my soul, and sing

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
of him who died for thee,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and hail him as thy matchless King

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
through all eternity.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Crown him the Lord of love!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
behold his hands and side,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
those wounds, yet visible above,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
in beauty glorified;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No angel in the sky

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Can fully bear that sight,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But downward bend his wondering eye

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
At mysteries so great.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Crown him the Lord of peace!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
whose power a scepter sways

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
from pole to pole, that wars may cease,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and all be prayer and praise.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
His reign shall know no end,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and round his pierced feet

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
fair flowers of paradise extend

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
their fragrance ever sweet.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Crown him the Lord of years;

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The potentate of time,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Creator of the rolling spheres,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Ineffably sublime!

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
All hail, Redeemer, hail!

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
For thou hast died for me;

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
thy praise shall never, never fail

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
throughout eternity.
