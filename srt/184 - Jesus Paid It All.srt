1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I hear the Savior say,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
“Thy strength indeed is small;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Child of weakness, watch and pray,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Find in Me thine all in all.”

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Jesus paid it all,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
All to Him I owe;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sin had left a crimson stain,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He washed it white as snow.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lord, now indeed I find

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thy power and Thine alone,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Can change the leper’s spots

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And melt the heart of stone.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Since nothing good have I

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Whereby Thy grace to claim,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I’ll wash my garments white

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
In the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And when before the throne

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I stand in Him complete,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I’ll lay my trophies down

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All down at Jesus’ feet.
