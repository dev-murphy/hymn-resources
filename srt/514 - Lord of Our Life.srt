1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord of our life, and God of our salvation,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Star of our night, and hope of every nation,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hear and receive Thy church’s supplication,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Lord God Almighty.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Lord, Thou canst help when earthly armor faileth;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Lord, Thou canst save when deadly sin assaileth;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Lord, o’er Thy rock nor death nor hell prevaileth;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Grant us Thy peace, Lord

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Peace in our hearts our evil thoughts assuaging;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Peace in Thy church, where brothers are engaging;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Peace, when the world its busy war is waging;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Send us, O Savior.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Grant us Thy help till foes are backward driven;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Grant them Thy truth that they may be forgiven;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Grant peace on earth, and, after we have striven,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Peace in Thy heaven.
