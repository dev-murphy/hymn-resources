1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The Son of God proclaim,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The Lord of time and space;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The God who bade the light break forth

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now shines in Jesus’ face.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Behold His out stretched hands,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Though all was in His power

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He took the towel and basin then,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And serves us in this hour.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He, God’s creative word,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The church’s Lord and head,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Here bids us gather as His friends,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And share His wine and bread.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The Lord of life and death

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
With wondering praise we sing;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We break the bread at His command,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And name Him God and King.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We take this cup in hope:

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
For He, who gladly bore

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The shameful cross, is ris’n again,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And reigns forevermore.
