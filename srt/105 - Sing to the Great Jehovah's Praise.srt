1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Sing to the great Jehovah’s praise!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All praise to Him belongs;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Who kindly lengthens out our days,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In spires our choicest songs,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Inspires our choicest songs.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
His providence hath brought us through

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Another various year;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We all, with vows and anthems new,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Before our God appear,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Before our God appear.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
O God, Thy mercies past we own,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And Thy continued care;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
To Thee presenting through Thy Son

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What e’er we have and are,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What e’er we have and are.
