1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
“Forgive our sins as we forgive,”

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You taught us, Lord, to pray;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But You alone can grant us grace

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To live the words we say.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
How can Your pardon reach and bless

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The unforgiving heart

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That broods on wrongs and will not let

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Old bitterness depart?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
In blazing light Your cross reveals

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The truth we dimly knew:

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
How trifling others’ debts to us;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
How great our debt to You!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Lord, cleanse the depths within our souls

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And bid resentment cease;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then, by Your mercy reconciled,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Our lives will spread Your peace.
