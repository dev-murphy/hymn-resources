1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O Lord, now let Your servant

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Depart in heav’nly peace,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For I have seen the glory

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Of Your redeeming grace:

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
A light to lead the Gentiles

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Unto Your holy hill,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The glory of Your people,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Your chosen Israel.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Then grant that I may follow Your gleam,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
O glorious Light,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Till earthly shadows scatter,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And faith is changed to sight;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Till raptured saints shall gather

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Upon that shining shore,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Where Christ, the blessed Day star,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Shall light them evermore.
