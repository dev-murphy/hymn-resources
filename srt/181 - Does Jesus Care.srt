1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Does Jesus care when my heart is pained

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Too deeply for mirth and song;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
As the burdens press, and the cares distress,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And the way grows weary and long?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O yes, He cares- I know He cares!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
His heart is touched with my grief;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When the days are weary,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The long nights dreary,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I know my Savior cares. (He cares.)

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Does Jesus care when my way is dark

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
With a nameless dread and fear?

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
As the daylight fades into deep night shades,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Does He care enough to be near?

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Does Jesus care when I’ve said goodbye

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To the dearest on earth to me,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks ­

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Is it aught to Him? Does He see?
