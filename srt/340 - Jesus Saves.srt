1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We have heard a joyful sound,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Jesus saves, Jesus saves;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Spread the gladness all around,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Jesus saves, Jesus saves;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Bear the news to every land,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Climb the steeps and cross the waves,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Onward, ’tis our Lord’s command,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Jesus saves, Jesus saves.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Waft it on the rolling tide,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Jesus saves, Jesus saves;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Tell to sinners, far and wide,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Jesus saves, Jesus saves;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sing, ye islands of the sea.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Echo back, ye ocean caves,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Earth shall keep her jubilee,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Jesus saves, Jesus saves.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Sing above the battle’s strife,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Jesus saves, Jesus saves;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
By His death and endless life,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Jesus saves, Jesus saves;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Sing it softly through the gloom,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
When the heart for mercy craves,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Sing in triumph o’er the tomb,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Jesus saves, Jesus saves.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Give the winds a mighty voice,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Jesus saves, Jesus saves;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let the nations now rejoice,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Jesus saves, Jesus saves;

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Shout salvation full and free,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Highest hills and deepest caves,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This our song of victory,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Jesus saves, Jesus saves.
