1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Unto the hills around shall I lift up my longing eyes?

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
O whence for me shall my salvation come, from whence arise?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
From God the Lord doth come my certain aid,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
From God the Lord, who heav’n and earth hath made.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He will not suffer that thy foot be moved; safe shalt Thou be.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
No careless slumber shall His eyelids close, who keepeth thee.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Behold our God, the Lord, He slumbereth ne’er,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Who keepeth Israel in His holy care.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Jehovah is Himself thy keeper true, thy changeless shade.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Jehovah they defense on thy right hand Himself hath made.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And thee no sun by day shall ever smite,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
No moon shall harm thee in the silent night.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
From every evil shall He keep thy soul, from every sin;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Jehovah shall preserve thy going our,n thy coming in.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Above thee watching, He, whom we adore.,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Shall keep thee henceforth, yea, forevermore.
