1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There’s a land that is fairer than day,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And by faith we can see it afar;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For the Father waits over the way

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To prepare us a dwelling place there.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In the sweet in the sweet

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
By and by by and by,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We shall meet on that beautiful shore;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In the sweet in the sweet

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
By and by by and by

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We shall sing on that beautiful shore

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The melodious songs of the blest,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And our spirits shall sorrow no more

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To our bountiful father above

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We will offer our tribute of praise;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
For the glorious gift of His love

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And the blessings that hallow our days.
