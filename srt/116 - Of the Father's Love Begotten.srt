1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Of the Father’s love begotten,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Ere the worlds began to be,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He is Alpha and Omega,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He the source, the ending He,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Of the things that are, that have been,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And that future years shall see,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Evermore and evermore! Amen.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O ye heights of heaven adore Him;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Angel hosts, His praises sing;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Powers, dominions, bow before Him,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And extol our God and King;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let no tongue on earth be silent,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Every voice in concert ring,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Evermore and evermore! Amen.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Christ, to Thee with God the Father

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And, O Holy Ghost, to Thee,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hymn and chant and high thanksgiving

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And unwearied praises be.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Honor, glory, and dominion,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And eternal victory,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Evermore and evermore! Amen.
