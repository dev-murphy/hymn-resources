1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Redeemed through His infinite mercy,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
His child and forever I am.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Redeemed, redeemed,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Redeemed, redeemed,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
His child and forever I am.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Redeemed, and so happy in Jesus,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
No language my rapture can tell;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I know that the light of His presence

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
With me doth continually dwell.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I know there’s a crown that is waiting

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In yonder bright mansion for me;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And soon, with the saints made perfect,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
At home with the Lord I shall be.
