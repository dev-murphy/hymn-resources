1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O God, whose will is life and good

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For all of mortal breath:

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Unite in bonds of servanthood

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All those who strive with death.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Make strong their hands and hearts and wills

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To drive disease afar,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
To strive against the body’s ills

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And wage Your healing war.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
By healing of the sick and blind,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Christ’s mercy they proclaim,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Make known the great physician’s mind,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Affirm the Savior’s name.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Before them set Your gracious will,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That they, with heart and soul,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To You may consecrate their skill

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And make the sufferer whole.
