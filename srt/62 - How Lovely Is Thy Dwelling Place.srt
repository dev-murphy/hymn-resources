1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How lovely is Thy dwelling place,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
O Lord of hosts to me!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The tabenacles of Thy grace

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How pleasant, Lord, they be!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
My thirsty soul longs ardently,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yea, faints Thy courts to see;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
My very heart and flesh cry out,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O living God, for Thee.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Behold the sparrow findeth out

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
A house where-in to rest;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The swallow also, for herself

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Provided hath a nest.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Ev’n Thine own altars, where she safe

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Her young ones forth may bring,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
O Thou, almighty Lord of hosts,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Who art my God and King.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Blest are they in Thy house that dwell,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They ever give Thee praise.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Blest is the man whose strength Thou art,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
In whose heart are Thy ways.
