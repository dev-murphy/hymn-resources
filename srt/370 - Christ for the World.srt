1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Christ for the world we sing,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the world to Christ we bring,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
with loving zeal;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the poor, and them that mourn,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
the faint and overborne,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
sinsick and sorrow-worn,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
whom Christ doth heal.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Christ for the world we sing,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
the world to Christ we bring,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
with fervent prayer;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the wayward and the lost,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
by restless passions tossed,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
redeemed at countless cost,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
from dark despair.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Christ for the world we sing,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
the world to Christ we bring,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
with joyful song;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
the newborn souls, whose days,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
reclaimed from error’s ways,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
inspired with hope and praise,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
to Christ belong.
