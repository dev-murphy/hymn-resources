1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My Father is omnipotent

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And that you can’t deny;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
A God of might and miracles;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
‘Tis written in the sky.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It took a miracle to put the stars in place;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It took a miracle to hang the world in space.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But when He saved my soul,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Cleansed and made me whole,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It took a miracle of love and grace!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Though here His glory has been shown,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We still can’t fully see

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The wonders of His might, His throne;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
‘Till eternity.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The Bible tells us of His power

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And wisdom all way through;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And every little bird and flower

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Are testimonies, too.
