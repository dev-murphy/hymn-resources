1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How far from? I asked, as on

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I bent my steps-the watchman spake:

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
“the long, dark night is almost gone,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The morning soon will break.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Then weep no more, but speed thy flight,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
With Hope’s bright star guiding ray,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Till thou shalt reach the realms of light,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In everlasting days.”

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I asked the warrior on the field;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This was his soul-inspiring song:

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
“With courage, bold, the sword I’ll wield,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The battle is not long.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Then weep no more, but well endure

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The conflict, till thy work is done;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
For this we know, the prize is sure,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
When victory is won.”

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I asked again; earth, sea, and sun

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Seemed, with one voice, to make reply:

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
“Time’s wasting sands are nearly run,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Eternity is nigh.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Then weep no more-with warning tones,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Portentous signs are thickening round,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The whole creation, waiting, groans,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
To hear the trumpet sound.”

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Not far from home! O blessed thought!

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The traveler’s lonely heart to cheer;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Which oft a healing balm has brought,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And dried the mourner’s tear.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Then weep no more, since we shall meet

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Where weary footsteps never roam-

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Our trials past, our joys complete,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Safe in our Father’s home.
