1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The church’s one foundation

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is Jesus Christ her Lord;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
she is his new creation

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
by water and the Word.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
From heaven he came and sought her

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
to be his holy bride;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
with his own blood he bought her,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and for her life he died.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Elect from every nation,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
yet one o’er all the earth;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
her charter of salvation,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
one Lord, one faith, one birth;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
one holy name she blesses,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
partakes one holy food,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and to one hope she presses,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
with every grace endued.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Though with a scornful wonder

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
we see her sore oppressed,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
by schisms rent asunder,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
by heresies distressed,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
yet saints their watch are keeping;

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
their cry goes up, “How long?”

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And soon the night of weeping

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
shall be the morn of song.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
‘Mid toil and tribulation,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and tumult of her war,

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
she waits the consummation

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
of peace forevermore;

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
till, with the vision glorious,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
her longing eyes are blest,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and the great church victorious

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
shall be the church at rest.
