1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lift up the trumpet, and loud let it ring:

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Jesus is coming again!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Cheer up, ye pilgrims, be joyful and sing:

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Jesus is coming again!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Coming again, coming again,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Jesus is coming again!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Echo it, hilltops; proclaim it, ye plains:

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Jesus is coming again!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Coming in glory, the Lamb that was slain;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Jesus is coming again!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Heavings of earth, tell the vast, wondering throng:

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Jesus is coming again!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Tempests and whirlwinds, the anthem prolong;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Jesus is coming again!

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Nations are angry–by this we do know

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Jesus is coming again!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Knowledge increases; men run to and fro;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Jesus is coming again!
