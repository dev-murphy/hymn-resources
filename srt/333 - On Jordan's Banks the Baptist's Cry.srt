1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
On Jordan’s banks the Baptist’s cry

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Announces that the Lord is nigh;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Awake and hearken, for he brings

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Glad tidings of the King of kings!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Then cleansed be every life from sin;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Make straight the way for God within,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And let us all our hearts prepare

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
For Christ to come and enter there.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We hail You as our Savior, Lord,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Our refuge and our great reward;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Without Your grace we waste away

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Like flow’rs that wither and decay.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Stretch forth Your hand, our health restore,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And make us rise to fall no more;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, let Your face upon us shine

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And fill the world with love divine.
