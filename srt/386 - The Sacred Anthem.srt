1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The sacred anthem slowly rang

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Across the fields of praise,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When earth’s first Sabbath made complete

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All creatures and all days.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Walking with God, there,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Woman and man together share

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The blessed Sabbath mood;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And in that green and golden world

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Know all God’s works are good.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But now in our diminished lives

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We sing a blemished song;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The earth is worn and disarrayed

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And all our work goes wrong.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Still in our worship,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Joining in praise and fellowship,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
By Sabbath radiance blessed,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We put our doubt and fear away

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And rest within God’s rest.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And arching over time and space

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The Lord of Sabbaths wills

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Renewal for the weary earth

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And healing for our ills.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Hearts will rejoice then;

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There will be no more weeping, when

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We know and shall be known.

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
With hosts of the redeemed we’ll sing

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Around God’s shining throne.
