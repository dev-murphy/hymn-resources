1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
‘Tis love that makes us happy,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
‘Tis love that smooths the way;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It helps us mind, it makes us kind

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To others every day.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
God is love; we’re his little children.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
God is love; we would be like Him.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
‘Tis love that makes us happy,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
‘Tis love that smooths the way;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It helps us “mind,” it makes us kind

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To others every day.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This world is full of sorrow,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Of sickness, death, and sin;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
With loving heart we’ll do our part,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And try some soul to win.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And when this life is over,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And we are called above

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Our song shall be, eternally,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Of Jesus and His love.
