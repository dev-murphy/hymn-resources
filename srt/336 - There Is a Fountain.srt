1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel’s veins;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Lose all their guilty stains, lose all their guilty stains;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And there may I, though vile as he, wash all my sins away.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Wash all my sins away, wash all my sins away;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And there may I, though vile as he, wash all my sins away.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thou dying Lamb, Thy precious blood shall never lose its power

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Till all the ransomed church of God are saved, to sin no more.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Are saved, to sin no more, are saved, to sin no more;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Till all the ransomed church of God are saved, to sin no more.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
E’er since, by faith, I saw the stream Thy flowing wounds supply,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Redeeming love has been my theme, and shall be till I die.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And shall be till I die, and shall be till I die;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Redeeming love has been my theme, and shall be till I die.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Lord, I believe Thou hast prepared, unworthy though I be,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
For me a blood-bought free reward, a golden harp for me!

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
A golden harp for me! A golden harp for me!

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
For me a blood-bought free reward, a golden harp for me!

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
There in a nobler, sweeter song, I’ll sing Thy power to save,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue is ransomed from the the grave.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Is ransomed from the grave, is ransomed from the grace;

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue is ransomed from the the grave.
