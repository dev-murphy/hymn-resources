1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He makes me down to lie

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In pastures green; He leadeth me

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The quiet waters by.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
My soul He doth restore again.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And me to walk doth make

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Within the paths of righteousness,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
E’en for His own name’s sake.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yea, though I walk in death’s dark vale,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yet will I fear no ill,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
For Thou art with me; and Thy rod

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And staff me comfort still.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
My table Thou hast furnished

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In presence of my foes;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
My head Thou dost with oil anoint,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And my cup overflows.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Goodness and mercy all my life

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Shall surely follow me;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And in God’s house forevermore

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
My dwelling place shall be.
