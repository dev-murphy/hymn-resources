1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let all things now living a song of thanksgiving

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To God the Creator triumphantly raise,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Who fashioned and made us, protected and stayed us,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Who guideth us on to the end of our days.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
His banners are o’er us,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
His light goes before us,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
A pillar of fire shining forth in the night,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
‘Til shadows have vanished and darkness is banished,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
as forward we travel from light into light.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
His law He enforces: the stars in their courses,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The sun in His orbit, obediently shine;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The hills and the mountains, the rivers and fountains,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The deeps of the ocean proclaim Him divine,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We too should be voicing our love and rejoicing,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
With glad adoration a song let us raise,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
‘Til all things now living unite in thanksgiving

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
To God in the highest, hosanna and praise.
