1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Who is He in yonder stall,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
At whose feet the shepherds fall?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
‘Tis the Lord, O wondrous story,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
‘Tis the Lord, the King of glory!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
At His feet we humbly fall,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Crown Him, crown Him Lord of all.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
At His feet we humbly fall- the Lord of all.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Crown Him, crown Him, Jesus, Jesus,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Crown Him Lord of all.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who is He in deep distress,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Fasting in the wilderness?

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Who is He, the gathering throng

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Greet with loud triumphant song?

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Lo, at midnight, who is He

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Prays in dark Gethsemane?

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Who is He on yonder tree

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Dies in shame and agony?

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Who is He that from the grave

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Comes to heal and help and save?

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Who is He that from His throne

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Rules through all the world alone?
