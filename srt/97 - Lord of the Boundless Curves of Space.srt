1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord of the boundless curves of space

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And time’s deep mystery,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
To Your creative might we trace

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All nature’s energy.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Your mind conceived the galaxy,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Each atom’s secret planned,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And every age of history

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Your purpose, Lord, has spanned.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yours is the image stamped on man,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Though marred by man’s own sin;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And Yours the liberating plan

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Again his soul to win.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Give us to know Your truth; but more,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The strength to do Your will;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Until the love our souls adore

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Shall all our being fill.
