1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O there’ll be joy when the work is done,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Joy when the reapers gather home,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Bringing the sheaves at set of sun

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To the New Jerusalem.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Joy, joy, joy, there’ll be joy by and by,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Joy, joy, joy, where the joys never die;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Joy, joy, joy, for the day draweth nigh

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
When the workers gather home.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sweet are the songs that we hope to sing,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Grateful the thanks our hearts shall bring,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Praising forever Christ our King

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In the New Jerusalem.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Pure are the joys that await us there,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Many the golden mansions fair;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Jesus Himself doth them prepare,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
In the New Jerusalem.
