1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There is a land of pure delight,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Where bliss eternal reigns,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Infinite day excludes the night

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And pleasures banish pain.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We’re trav’ling to Immanuel’s land,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We soon shall hear the trumpet sound,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And soon we shall with Jesus reign,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And never, never part again.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What! Never part again? No, never part again,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What! Never part again? No, never part again,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And soon we shall with Jesus reign,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And never, never part again.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There everlasting spring abides,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And never with’ring flowers,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And but a little space divides

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This heav’nly land from ours.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Could we but stand where Moses stood,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And view the landscape o’er,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Not all this world’s pretended good

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Could ever charm us more.
