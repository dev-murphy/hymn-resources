1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I heard the voice of Jesus say,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
“Come unto Me and rest;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thy head upon My breast.”

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I came to Jesus as I was,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Weary and worn and sad;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I found in Him a resting place,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And He has made me glad.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I heard the voice of Jesus say,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
“Behold, I freely give

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The living water; thirsty one,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Stoop down and drink and live.”

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I came to Jesus, and I drank

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Of that life giving stream;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
My thirst was quench’d, my soul revived,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And now I live in Him.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I heard the voice of Jesus say,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
“I am this dark world’s light;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And all thy day be bright.”

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I looked to Jesus, and I found

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In Him my star, my sun;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And in that light of life I’ll walk,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Till trav’ling days are done.
