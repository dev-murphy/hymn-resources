00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord of the Sabbath and its light,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I hail Thy hallowed day of rest;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is my weary soul’s delight,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The solace of my careworn breast,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The solace of my careworn breast.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
O sacred day of peace and joy,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thy hours are ever dear to me;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Ne’er may a sinful thought destroy

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The holy calm I find in thee,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The holy calm I find in thee.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
How sweetly now they glide along!

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
How hallowed is the calm they yield!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Transporting is their rapturous song,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And heavenly visions seem revealed,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And heavenly visions seem revealed.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
O Jesus, let me ever hail

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thy presence with the day of rest;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Then will Thy servant never fail

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
To deem Thy Sabbath doubly blest,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
To deem Thy Sabbath doubly blest.
