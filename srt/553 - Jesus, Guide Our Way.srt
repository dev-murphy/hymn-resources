1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jesus, guide our way

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To eternal day:

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So shall we, no more delaying,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Follow Thee, Thy voice obeying:

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Lead us by the hand

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To our Father’s land.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When we danger meet

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Steadfast make our feet;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lord, preserve us uncomplaining

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Mid the darkness round us reigning:

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Through adversity lies our way to Thee.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Order all our way

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Through the mortal day:

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In our toil, with aid be near us:

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In our need, with succour cheer us:

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Till we safely stand

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In our Father’s land.
