1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Dear Lord, we come at set of sun,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And at Your feet we kneel

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
To worship You, Creator, King,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This day, Your sign and seal.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Our earthly tasks we lay aside,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
According to Your Word,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
To enter now Your holy rest,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The Sabbath of the Lord.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sweet Sabbath rest, your sacred hours

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Are as a golden chain

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That reaches back to Eden’s gate

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And points us home again.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And when this earth shall be renewed,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And sin and death destroyed,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Shall all redeemed each Sabbath day

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Still meet to praise their God.
