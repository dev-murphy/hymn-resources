1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A wonderful Savior to me,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Where rivers of pleasure I see.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That shadows a dry, thirsty land;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
he hideth my life in the depths of His love,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And covers me there with His hand,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And covers me there with His hand.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He taketh my burden away,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He giveth me strength as my day.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And filled with His fullness divine,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I sing in my rapture, Oh, Glory to God

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
For such a Redeemer as mine.

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
To meet Him in clouds of the sky,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I’ll shout with the millions on high.
