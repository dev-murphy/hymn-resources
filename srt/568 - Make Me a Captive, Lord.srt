1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Make me a captive, Lord, and then I shall be free;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Force me to render up my sword, and I shall conqueror be.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I sink in life’s alarms when by myself I stand;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Imprison me within Thine arms, and strong shall be my hand.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
My heart is weak and poor until it amaster find;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It has no spring of action sure, it varies with the wind.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It cannot freely move till Thou has wrought its chain;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Enslave it with Thy matchless love, and deathless it shall reign.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
My will is not my own till Thou hast made it Thine;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If it would reach a monarch’s throne, it must its crown resign;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It only stands unbent, amid the clashing strife,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
When on Thy bosom it has leant, and found in Thee its life.
