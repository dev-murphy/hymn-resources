1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Tell out my soul, the greatness of the Lord:

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Unnumbered blessings, give my spirit voice;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Tender to me the promise of His Word;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In God my Saviour shall my heart rejoice.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His name:

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Make known His might, the deeds His arm has done;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
His mercy sure, from age to age the same;

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
His holy name, the Lord, the Mighty One.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His might:

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Pow’rs and dominions lay their glory by;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Proud hearts and stubborn wills are put to flight,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The hungry fed, the humble lifted high.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Tell out, my soul, the glories of His word:

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Firm is His promise, and His mercy sure.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
To children’s children and forevermore.
