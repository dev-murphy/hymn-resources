1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lord, I have made Thy word my choice,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
My lasting heritage;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There shall my noblest powers rejoice,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
My warmest thoughts engage.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I’ll read the histories of Thy love,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And keep Thy laws in sight;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
While through Thy promises I rove,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
With ever fresh delight.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
In this broad land of wealth unknown,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Where springs of life arise,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Seeds of immortal bliss are sown,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And hidden glory lies.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The best relief that mourners have,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It makes our sorrows blest;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Our fairest hope beyond the grave,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And our eternal rest.
