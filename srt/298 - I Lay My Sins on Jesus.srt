1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I lay my sins on Jesus,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The spotless Lamb of God;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He bears them all, and frees us

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
From the accursed load,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
From the accursed load.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I bring my guilt to Jesus,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
To wash my crimson stains

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
White in His blood most precious

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Till not a stain remains,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Till not a stain remains.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I lay my wants on Jesus,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All fullness dwells in Him;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He healeth my diseases

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He doth my soul redeem,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He doth my soul redeem

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I long to be with Jesus,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Meek, loving, lowly, mild;

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I long to be like Jesus

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The Father’s holy child,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The Father’s holy child.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I long to be with Jesus

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Amid the heav’nly throng,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
To sing with them His praises,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And learn the angels’ song.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And learn the angels’ song.
