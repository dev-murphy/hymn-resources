1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The head that once was crowned with thorns

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Is crowned with glory now;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
A royal diadem adorns

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The mighty victor’s brow.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The highest place that heaven affords

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Is His, is His by right;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The King of kings, and Lord of lords,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And heaven’s eternal light.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The joy of all who dwell above,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The joy of all below,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
To whom He manifests His love,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And grants His name to know.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
4

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To them the cross, with all its shame,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
With all its grace is given;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Their name an everlasting name,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Their joy the joy of heaven.

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
To them the cross, with all its shame,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
With all its grace is given;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Their name an everlasting name,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Their joy the joy of heaven.
