1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Jerusalem, my happy home,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
O how I long for thee!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When will my sorrows have an end,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The joys when shall I see?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The walls are all of precious stone,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Most glorious to behold;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thy gates are richly set with pearl,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thy streets are paved with gold.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thy garden and thy pleasant walks

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My study long have been;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Such dazzling views by human sight

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Have never yet been seen.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Lord, help us by Thy mighty grace,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To keep in view the prize,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Till Thou dost come to take us home

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
To that blessed paradise.
