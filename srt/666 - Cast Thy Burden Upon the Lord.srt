1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And He shall sustain thee;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He never will suffer the righteous to fall;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He is at thy right hand.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thy mercy, Lord, is great, and far above the heavens;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let none be made ashamed, that wait upon Thee.
