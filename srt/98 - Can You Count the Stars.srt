1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Can you count the stars that brightly

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Twinkle in the midnight sky?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Can you count the clouds, so lightly

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
O’er the meadows floating by?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
God, the Lord, doth mark their number

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
With His eyes that never slumber;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He hath made them every one,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He hath made them every one.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Can you count the wings now flashing

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In the sunshine’s golden light?

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Can you count the fishes splashing

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In the cooling waters bright?

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
God, the Lord, a name hath given,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To all creatures under heaven;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He hath named them every one,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He hath named them every one.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Do you know how many children

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Rise each morning blithe and gay?

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Can you count their jolly voices,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Singing sweetly day by day?

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
God hears all the happy voices,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In their merry songs rejoices;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And He loves them, every one,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And He loves them, every one.
