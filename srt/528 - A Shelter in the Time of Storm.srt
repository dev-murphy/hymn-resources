1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The Lord’s our Rock, in Him we hide,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A shelter in the time of storm;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Secure whatever ill betide,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A shelter in the time of storm.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Mighty Rock in a weary land,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Cooling shade on the burning sand,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Faithful guide for the pilgrim band—

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A shelter in the time of storm.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
A shade by day, defense by night,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
A shelter in the time of storm;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No fears alarm, no foes afright,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
A shelter in the time of storm.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The raging storms may round us beat,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
A shelter in the time of storm

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We find in God a safe retreat,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
A shelter in the time of storm.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O Rock divine, O Refuge dear,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
A Shelter in the time of storm;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Be Thou our helper ever near,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
A Shelter in the time of storm.
