1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O listen to our wondrous story,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Counted once among the lost;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yet One came down from heaven’s glory,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Saving us at awful cost!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Who saved us from eternal loss?

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Who but God’s Son upon the cross?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What did He do? He died for you!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Where is He now? Believe it thou,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
In heaven interceding! In heaven interceding!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
No angel could His place have taken,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Highest of the high tho’ he;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The loved One on the cross forsaken

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Was One of the Godhead three!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Will you surrender to this Savior?

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To His scepter humbly bow?

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You, too, shall come to know His favor,

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He will save you, save you now.
