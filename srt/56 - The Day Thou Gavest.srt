1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the darkness falls at Thy behest;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
to Thee our morning hymns ascended;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thy praise shall hallow now our rest.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We thank Thee that Thy church, unsleeping

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
while earth rolls onward into light,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
through all the world her watch is keeping,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and rests not now by day or night.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
As o’er each continent and island

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the dawn leads on another day,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the voice of prayer is never silent,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
nor die the strains of praise away.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So be it, Lord; Thy throne shall never,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
like earth’s proud empires, pass away.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thy kingdom stands, and grows forever,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
till all Thy creatures own Thy sway.
