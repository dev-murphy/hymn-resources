1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My song is love unknown,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
My Savior’s love to me,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Love to the loveless shown,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That they might lovely be.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O who am I that for my sake

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
My Lord should take frail flesh and die?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He came from His blest throne,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Salvation to bestow,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But men made strange, and none

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The longed for Christ would know.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But O my Friend, my Friend indeed

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Who at my need His life did spend.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sometimes they strew His way,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And His sweet praises sing,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Resounding all the day,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Hosannas to their King.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Then “Crucify” is all their breath,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And for His death they thirst and cry.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Why, what hath my Lord done?

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What makes this rage and spite?

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He made the lame to run,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He gave the blind their sight.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Sweet injuries! yet they at these

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Themselves displease, and ‘gainst Him rise.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
They rise, and needs will have

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
My dear Lord made away;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
A murderer they save,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The Prince of life they slay.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yet cheerful He to suff’ring goes,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That He His foes from thence might free.

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Here might I stay and sing,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No story so divine:

33
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Never was love, dear King,

34
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Never was grief like Thine!

35
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise

36
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I all my days could gladly spend.
