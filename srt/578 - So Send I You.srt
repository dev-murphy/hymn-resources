1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So sent I you- by grace made strong to triumph

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
O’er hosts of hell, o’er darkness, death, and sin,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My name to bear, and in that name to conquer-

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So send I you, My victory to win.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So send I you- to take to souls in bondage

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The word of truth that sets the captive free,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
To break the bonds of sin, to loose dearth’s fetters-

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So send I you, to bring the lost to Me.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So send I you- My strength to know in weakness,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My joy in grief, my perfect peace in pain,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
To prove My power, My grace, My promised presence-

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So send I you, eternal fruit to gain.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So Send I you – to bear My cross with patience,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And then one day with joy to lay it down

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To hear My voice, “Well done, My faithful servant –

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Come, share My throne, My Kingdom, and My crown!”

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
As the Father hath sent Me, so send I You.”
