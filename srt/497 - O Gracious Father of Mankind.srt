1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O gracious Father of mankind,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Our spirits’ unseen friend;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
High heaven’s Lord, our hearts’ dear guest,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To Thee our prayers ascend.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thou dost not wait till human speech

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thy gifts divine implore;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Our dreams, our aims, our work, our lives

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Are prayers Thou lovest more.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thou hearest these, the good and ill,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Deep buried in each breast;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The secret thought, the hidden plan,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Wrought out our unexpressed.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O cleanse our prayers from human dross,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Attune our lives to Thee,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Until we labor for those gifts

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We ask on bended knee.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Our best is but Thyself in us,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Our highest thought Thy will;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
To hear Thy voice we need but love,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And listen, and be still.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We would not bend Thy will to ours,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But blend our wills to Thine;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Not dreams, our aims, our work, our lives

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Are prayers Thou lovest more.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Thou seekest us in love and truth

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
More than our minds seek Thee;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Through open gates Thy power flows in

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Like flood tides from the sea.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
No more we seek Thee from afar,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Nor ask Thee for a sign,

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Content to pray in life and love

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And toil, till all are Thine.
