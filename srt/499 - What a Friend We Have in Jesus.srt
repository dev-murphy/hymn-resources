1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What a friend we have in Jesus,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All our sins and griefs to bear!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What a privilege to carry

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Everything to God in prayer!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh, what peace we often forfeit;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, what needless pain we bear

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
All because we do not carry

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Everything to God in prayer!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Have we trials and temptations?

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Is there trouble anywhere?

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We should never be discouraged

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Can we find a friend so faithful

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Who will all our sorrows share?

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Jesus knows our every weakness

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Are we weak and heavy laden,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Cumbered with a load of care?

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Precious Savior, still our refuge

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Do your friends despise, forsake you?

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
In his arms he’ll take and shield you;

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You will find a solace there.
