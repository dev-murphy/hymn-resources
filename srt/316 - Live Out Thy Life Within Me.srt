1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Live out Thy life within me, O Jesus, King of kings!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Be Thou Thyself the answer To all my questionings;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Live out Thy life within me, In all things have Thy way!

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I, the transparent medium Thy glory to display.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The temple has been yielded, And purified of sin;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let Thy Shekinah glory Now shine forth from within,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And all the earth keep silence, The body henceforth be

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thy silent, gentle servant, Moved only as by Thee.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Its members every moment Held subject to Thy call,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Ready to have Thee use them, Or not be used at all;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Held without restless longing, Or strain, or stress, or fret

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Or chafings at Thy dealings, Or thoughts of vain regret.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But restful, calm, and pliant, From bend and bias free,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Awaiting Thy decision, When Thou hast need of me.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Live out Thy life within me, O Jesus, King of kings!

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Be Thou the glorious answer To all my questionings.
