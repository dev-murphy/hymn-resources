1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come let us sing of homeland,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Down by the crystal sea;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Wonderful land where Jesus

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Buildeth a mansion for me.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Over yonder, down by the crystal sea,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
                       down              by the crystal sea,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Over yonder, there’s where I long to be,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
                       There’s            where I long to be,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No more sorrow, toil, grief, nor care,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In the homeland bright and fair,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Over, over there.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
                  Over there.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Water of life there floweth,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Fruit in abundant store;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Citizens of that country

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Hunger and thirst never more.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Come go with me to homeland,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Jesus invites you there;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Help spread the invitation,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Tell it to men everywhere.
