1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We have heard from the bright, the holy, land;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We have heard, and our hearts are glad;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For we were a lonely pilgrim band,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And weary, and worn, and sad.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
They tell us the saints have a dwelling there-

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
No longer are homeless ones;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And we know that the goodly land is fair,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Where life’s pure river runs.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
They say green fields are waving there,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That never a blight shall know;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And the deserts wild are blooming fair,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And the roses of Sharon grow.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There are lovely birds in the bowers green,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Their songs are blithe and sweet;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And their warblings, gushing ever new,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The angels’ harpings greet.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We have heard of the palms, the robes, the crowns,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And the silvery band in white;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Of the city fair, with pearly gates,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All radiant with light.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We have heard of the angels there, and saints,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
With their harps of gold, how they sing;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Of the mount with the fruitful tree of life,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Of the leaves that healing bring.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The King of that country, He is fair,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He’s the joy and light of the place;

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
In His beauty we shall behold Him there,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And bask in His smiling face,

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We’ll be there, we’ll be there in a little while,

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We’ll join the pure and the blest;

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We’ll have the palm, the robe, the crown,

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And forever be at rest.
