1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Sing the wondrous love of Jesus;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Sing his mercy and his grace.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In the mansions bright and blessed

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He’ll prepare for us a place.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
When we all get to heaven,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What a day of rejoicing that will be!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When we all see Jesus,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We’ll sing and shout the victory!

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
While we walk the pilgrim pathway,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Clouds will overspread the sky;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But when traveling days are over,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Not a shadow, not a sigh.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let us then be true and faithful,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Trusting, serving every day;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Just one glimpse of him in glory

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Will the toils of life repay.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Onward to the prize before us!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Soon his beauty we’ll behold;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Soon the pearly gates will open;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We shall tread the streets of gold.
