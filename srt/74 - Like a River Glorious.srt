1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Like a river glorious, is God’s perfect peace,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Over all victorious, in its bright increase;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Perfect, yet it floweth, fuller every day,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Perfect, yet it groweth, deeper all the way.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blessed

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Finding, as He promised, perfect peace and rest.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Hidden in the hollow of His blessed hand,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Never foe can follow, never traitor stand;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Not a surge of worry, not a shade of care,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Not a blast of hurry touch the spirit there.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Every joy or trial falleth from above,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Traced upon our dial by the Sun of Love;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We may trust Him fully all for us to do.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
They who trust Him wholly find Him wholly true.
