1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Awake, awake to love and work!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The lark is in the sky;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The fields are wet with diamond dew;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The worlds awake to cry

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Their blessings on the Lord of life,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
As He goes meekly by.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Come, let thy voice be one with theirs,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Shout with their shout of praise;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
See how the giant sun soars up,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Great lord of years and days!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So let the love of Jesus come

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And set thy soul ablaze.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
To give and give, and give again,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What God hath given thee;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To spend thyself nor count the cost;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
To serve right gloriously

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The God who gave all worlds that are,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And all that are to be.
