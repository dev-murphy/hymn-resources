1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Beneath the cross of Jesus

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I fain would take my stand,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the shadow of a mighty rock

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
within a weary land;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
a home within the wilderness,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
a rest upon the way,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
from the burning of the noontide heat,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and the burden of the day.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Upon that cross of Jesus

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
mine eye at times can see

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the very dying form of One

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
who suffered there for me;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and from my stricken heart with tears

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
two wonders I confess:

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
the wonders of redeeming love

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and my unworthiness.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I take, O cross, thy shadow

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
for my abiding place;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I ask no other sunshine than

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the sunshine of his face;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
content to let the world go by,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
to know no gain nor loss,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
my sinful self my only shame,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
my glory all the cross.
