1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Tell me the story of Jesus,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Write on my heart every word.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Tell me the story most precious,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sweetest that ever was heard.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Tell how the angels in chorus,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Sang as they welcomed His birth.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
“Glory to God in the highest!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Peace and good tidings to earth.”

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Tell me the story of Jesus,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Write on my heart every word.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Tell me the story most precious,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Sweetest that ever was heard.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Fasting alone in the desert,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Tell of the days that are past.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
How for our sins He was tempted,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yet was triumphant at last.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Tell of the years of His labor,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Tell of the sorrow He bore.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He was despised and afflicted,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Homeless, rejected and poor.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Tell of the cross where they nailed Him,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Writhing in anguish and pain.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Tell of the grave where they laid Him,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Tell how He liveth again.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Love in that story so tender,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Clearer than ever I see.

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Stay, let me weep while you whisper,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Love paid the ransom for me.
