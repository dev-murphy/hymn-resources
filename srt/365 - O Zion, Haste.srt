1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O Zion, haste, thy mission high fulfilling,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to tell to all the world that God is light,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
that he who made all nations is not willing

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
one soul should perish, lost in shades of night.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Proclaim to every people, tongue, and nation

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
that God, in whom they live and move, is love;

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
tell how he stooped to save his lost creation,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and died on earth that we might live above.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Give of thine own to bear the message glorious;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
give of thy wealth to speed them on their way;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
pour out thy soul for them in prayer victorious;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
O Zion, haste to bring the brighter day.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He comes again; O Zion, ere thou meet Him,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Make known to every heart His saving grace;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let none whom He hath ransomed fail to greet Him,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Through thy neglect, unfit to see His face.
