1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Be still, my soul:

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the Lord is on thy side;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain;

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Leave to thy God to order and provide;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In every change He faithful will remain.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Be still, my soul:thy

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
best, thy heavenly friend

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Be still, my soul:

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
thy God doth undertake

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
To guide the future as He has the past.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Be still, my soul: the waves and winds still know

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
His voice who ruled them while He dwelt below.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Be still, my soul:

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
the hour is hastening on

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
When we shall be forever with the Lord,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Sorrow forgot, love’s purest joys restored.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Be still, my soul: when change and tears are past,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.
