1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We have not known Thee as we ought,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Nor learned Thy wisdom, grace, and power;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The things of earth have filed our thoughts,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And trifles of the passing hour.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Lord, give us light Thy truth to see,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And make us wise in knowing Thee.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We have not feared Thee as we ought,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Nor bowed beneath Thine awful eye,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Nor guarded deed, and word, and thought,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Remembering that God was nigh.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Lord, give us faith to know Thee near,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And grant the grace of holy fear.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We have not loved Thee as we ought,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Nor cared that we are loved by Thee;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thy presence we have coldly sought,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And feebly longed Thy face to see.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Lord, give a pure and loving heart

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
To feel and own the love Thou art.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We have not served Thee as we ought;

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Alas! the duties left undone,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The work with little fervor wrought,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The battles lost, or scarcely won!

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Lord, give the zeal, and give the might,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
For Thee to toil, for Thee to fight.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
When shall we know Thee as we ought,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And fear, and love, and serve aright!

27
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
When shall we, out of trial brought,

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Be perfect in the land of light!

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Lord, may we day by day prepare

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
To see Thy face, and serve Thee there.
