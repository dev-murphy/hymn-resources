1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O Thou in whose presence my soul takes delight,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
On whom in affliction I call,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My comfort by day and my song in the night,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
My hope, my salvation, my all!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
His voice, as the sound of the dulcimer sweet,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Is heard through the shadows of death;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The cedars of Lebanon bow at His feet,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The air is perfumed with His breath.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
His lips, as a fountain of righteousness flow,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To water the gardens of grace;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And bask in the smiles of His face.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And myriads wait for His word;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He speaks, and eternity, filled with His voice,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Re-echoes the praise of the Lord.
