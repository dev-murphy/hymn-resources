1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
“Go, preach My gospel,” saith the Lord;

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
“Bid the whole world My grace receive;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He shall be saved who trusts My word,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And they condemned who disbelieve.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
“I’ll make your great commission known,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And ye shall prove My gospel true

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
By all the works that I have done,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
By all the wonders ye shall do.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
“Teach all the nations My commands;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I’m with you till the world shall end;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All power is vested in My hands;

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I can destroy, and I defend.”

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He spake, and light shone round His head;

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
On a bright cloud to heaven He rode;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
They to the farthest nations spread

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The grace of their ascended Lord.
