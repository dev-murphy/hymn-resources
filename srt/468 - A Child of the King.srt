1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My Father is rich in houses and lands,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
His coffers are full, He has riches untold.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I’m a child of the King,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A child of the King:

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
With Jesus my Savior,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I’m a child of the King.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
My Father’s own Son, the Savior of men,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But now He is pleading our pardon on high,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That we may be His when He comes by and by.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I once was an outcast stranger on earth,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
A sinner by choice, an alien by birth,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But I’ve been adopted, my name’s written down,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
An heir to a mansion, a robe and a crown.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
A tent or a cottage, why should I care?

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They’re building a palace for me over there;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Though exiled from home, yet still may I sing:

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All glory to God, I’m a child of the King.
