1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Spring has now unwrapped the flowers,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Day is fast reviving,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Life in all her growing powers

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Towards the light is striving:

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Gone the iron touch of cold,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Winter time and frost time,

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Seedlings, working through the mould,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now make up for lost time.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Herb and plant that winter long,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Slumbered at their leisurek,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Now be stirring, green and strong,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Find in growth their pleasure:

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All the world with beauty fills,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Gold the green enhacing;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Flowers make glee among the hills,

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Set the meadows dancing.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Through each wonder of fair days

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
God Himself expresses;

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Beauty follows all His ways,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
As the world He blesses:

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So, as He renews the earth,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Artist without rival,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
In His grace of glad new birth

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We must seek revival.
