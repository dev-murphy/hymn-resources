1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Beneath the forms of outward rite

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thy supper, Lord, is spread

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In every quiet upper room

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Where fainting souls are fed.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The bread is always consecrate

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Which men divide with men;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And every act of brotherhood

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Repeats Thy feast again.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The blessed cup is only passed

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
True memory of Thee,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
When life anew pours out its wine

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
With rich sufficiency.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O Master, through these symbols shared,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Thine own dear self impart,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That in our daily life may flame

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The passion of Thy heart.
