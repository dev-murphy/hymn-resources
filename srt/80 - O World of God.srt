1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
O world of God, so vast and strange,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Profound and wonderful and fair,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Beyond the utmost reach of thought,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But not beyond a Father’s care!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We are not strangers on this earth

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Whirling amid the suns of space;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We are God’s children, this our home,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
With those of every clime and race.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O world of man where life is lived,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So strangely mingling joy and pain,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So full of evil and of good,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So needful that the god shall reign!

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It is this world that God has loved,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And goodness was its Maker’s plan,

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The promise of God’s triumph is

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
His coming in a Son of Man.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
O world of time’s far-stretching years!

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
There was a day when time stood still,

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
A central moment when there rose

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
A cross upon a cruel hill;

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
In pain and death love’s power was seen,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The mystery of time revealed,

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The wisdom of the ways of God,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The grace through which man’s hurt is healed.
