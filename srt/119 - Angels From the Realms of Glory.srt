1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Angels from the realms of glory,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Wing your flight o`er all the earth;

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Ye, who sang creation`s story,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now proclaim Messiah`s birth;

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Come and worship, Come and worship,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Worship Christ, the newborn King.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Shepherds, in the field abiding,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Watching o`er your flocks by night,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
God with man is now residing;

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yonder shines the Infant Light;

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Come and worship, Come and worship,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Worship Christ, the newborn King.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sages, leave your contemplations,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Brighter visions beam afar;

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Seek the great Desire of nations;

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Ye have seen His natal star;

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Come and worship, Come and worship,

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Worship Christ, the newborn King.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Saints, before the altar bending,

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Watching long in hope and fear,

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Suddenly the Lord, descending,

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In His temple shall appear;

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Come and worship, Come and worship,

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Worship Christ, the newborn King.
