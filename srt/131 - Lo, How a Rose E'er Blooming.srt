1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lo, how a rose e’re blooming

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
From tenderstem hath sprung,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Of Jesse’s lineage coming

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
As men of old have sung.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It came, a floweret bright,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Amid the cold of winter

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When half spent was the night.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Isaiah ’twas foretold it,

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The Rose I have in mind,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
With Mary we beheld it,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The virgin mother kind.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To show God’s love aright

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
She bore to them a Savior,

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
When half spent was the night.
