1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now the day is over,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
night is drawing nigh,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Shadows of the evening

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
steal across the sky.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Father, give the weary,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
calm and sweet repose;

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
With Thy tenderest blessing

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
May our eyelids close.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Through the long night watches,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
may thine angels spread

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Their white wings above me,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
watching round my bed.
